There’s also a torrentable version.”
According to the film summary, the new documentary “depicts the life of American computer programmer, writer, political organizer and Internet activist Aaron Swartz. It features interviews with his family and friends as well as the internet luminaries who worked with him. The film tells his story up to his eventual suicide after a legal battle, and explores the questions of access to information and civil liberties that drove his work.”
The Internet’s Own Boy will be added to our collection, 200 Free Documentaries Online, part of our larger collection, 700 Free Movies Online: Great Classics, Indies, Noir, Westerns, etc..
