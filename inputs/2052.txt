Rhetoric’s fourth canon—memory—is synonymous with the art of memory. Today,Â the constructionsÂ of theÂ ars memorativaÂ are known as “memory palaces,” and theyÂ have beenÂ popularized by characters like Hannibal Lecter and Sherlock Holmes. The technique goes back to the Greek sophists, for it is mentioned in the Dissoi Logoi (circa 420 BCE) and is said to have been formalized by the lyric poet Simonides of Ceos (d. 468 BCE). The artÂ was elaborated upon by the Romans and went through various transformationsÂ during the middle ages (in fact, it has been argued by Frances Yates, Lina Bolzoni, and others that theÂ Divine Comedy, with its carefully ordered visualizations of virtue and vice,Â presents nothing less than a Christianized memory palace).Â The art flourished during the early modern era despite the rise of print technologies and did not disappear from the intellectual scene until the late eighteenth century, demonstrating that until recently in history neither writing nor print were seenÂ as substitutes for a strongÂ memory, as they are today. As part of my dissertation on the art of memory, I searched severalÂ bibliographies of rhetoric, eventually compiling 423Â memory treatises. 261 were published between 1430 – 1800; 162 were published in the nineteenth century. Bibliographies consulted wereÂ Lawrence D. Green and James J. Murphy’sÂ Renaissance Rhetoric Short-Title Catalogue, 1460-1700; Heinrich F. Plett’sÂ English Renaissance Rhetoric and Poetics: A Systematic Bibliography of Primary and Secondary Sources; George S. Fellows’ âBibliography of Mnemonics,â published in A.E. Middleton, Memory Systems New and Old; and the British Libraryâs Incunabula Short Title Catalogue.Â At the bottomÂ of this post, there is a download link for an Excel file listing all treatises published between 1430 – 1800, with Date, Title, Author, Author’s Nationality, and Place of Publication. (I’ll upload the nineteenth century treatisesÂ at a later date.) Of course, that number 423 does not represent 423 unique treatises; many are second or third editions of an original work. But it was important to count multiple editions because I wasÂ interested primarily in the rise and fall of this genre’s (the memory treatise’s) popularity over time. Here are some graphs that have endedÂ up in my dissertation. The first graph displays all memory treatises published, by country, between 1551 – 1600. The second displays all memory treatises published, by country, between 1601 – 1650. The third displaysÂ memory treatises published in all countries, by half-century. Memory treatises published, by country, 1551-1600 Memory treatises published, by country, 1601-1650 Memory treatises published in Europe, per half-century There are several prominentÂ trends in these graphs that I analyze in the dissertation, but the one IÂ want to call attention to hereÂ is the drop in English memory treatises between the end of the sixteenth century and the beginning of the seventeenth. Between the years 1551 â 1600, England keeps pace with the publication of memory treatises on the continent. Between the years 1601 â 1650, however, with memory treatises flourishing in France and Germany, the publication of treatises in London slows down greatly. This is made especially curious by the fact that 1601 â 1650 marks the entrance of London as a major publication center. Before 1600, England was producing fewer than 160,000 books per year, compared to 700,000 per year in France and Germany and 800,000 in Italy. After 1601, however, England caught up to the continental powerhouses, publishing ~700,000 books annually from 1601 â 1650 (Buringh and Van Zanden, âRiseâ 418). Yet the genre of the memory treatise saw no corresponding rise in publication numbers. Indeed, looking at the total number of memory treatises published in Europe by half-century, the lack of London contributions between 1601 â 1650 appears even more remarkable, for those decades correspond to artificial memoryâs most popular period, judging by raw publication counts. So what could account for the sudden lack of interest in the art of memory in England at the turn of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries? OneÂ reason, I argue, is that the entire point of the art of memory is to furnish one’s mind withÂ elaborate and emotionally charged mental imagery. The art operates upon the notion that remediating knowledge into the semiotics of sight and dimension makes them easier to remember and to access. However, this was not a precept destined to be popular in an England that had come to be dominated byÂ iconoclastic Anglo Protestants, becauseÂ imagery, in Protestant England, was synonymous with Catholic religious practice, idolatry, and all manner of irrational superstitionâholy relics, indulgences, the veneration of saints. Perhaps the crucial event for understanding this rejection of imageryÂ is Henry VIIIâs dissolution of the monasteries, an episode that saw a literal smashing of the idolsââan orgy of iconoclasm,â in Leanda de Lisleâs words (Tudor 244)âwith books burned, altar-pieces ripped out, stained glass windows shattered, and art destroyed. The destruction wrought during this period was driven as much by opportunistic plundering and political intimidation as by abstract theological conflict, but the result was the same. Writing not long after those events, the antiquarian John Stow would write that the Protestants âjudged every image to be an idolâ (qtd. de Lisle 244), resulting in the loss of some ninety percent of medieval art housed in England (de Lisle, âA sad reminderâ). In such an environment, precepts for affective imagery are dead on arrival. As one Protestant ministerÂ wrote in condemnation of the art of memory: âA thing faigned in the mind by imagination is an idol.” In Art of Memory, Yates analyzesÂ a fewÂ early modern texts suggesting that many well-educated English Protestants hadÂ a distaste for the art of memory on iconoclastic grounds. I am glad that her argument remains intact (and is in fact strengthened) when taking a more “distant” bibliographic view. If Anglo iconoclasm did indeedÂ expedite the abandonment of the art of memory in England, then this history provides a good example of the influence of changing social environments on rhetorical practice. All rhetorical precepts are “creatures of historical circumstance,” Nan Johnson has written. Studying the historical transformationÂ of those precepts isÂ as valuable to understanding cultural evolution as is studying the transformationÂ of literary form.
