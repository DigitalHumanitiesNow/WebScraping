Pleiades (http://pleiades.stoa.org) gives scholars, students and enthusiasts worldwide the ability to               use, create and share historical geographic information about the Greek and Roman World. Pleiades               is a joint project of three organizations: the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (New York               University), the Ancient World Mapping Center (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) and the               Stoa Consortium for Electronic Publication in the Humanities (University of Kentucky). Our goal is a               continuously updated, authoritative digital gazetteer for the ancient world, supporting the widest possible               range of third-party digital projects and publications through open, standards-based interfaces. From its               earliest concept days, Pleiades was intended to be broadly collaborative: employing, modifying and               engendering open-content information and open-source software to accomplish its mission. This paper               reports on the associated provisions and assesses their reach and effects within our user community,               and beyond.
