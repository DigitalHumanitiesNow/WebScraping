Drag and zoom to explore. Key to icons:  Large red = Community Centres  Large purple = Libraries  Large blue = Arenas  Small green = Heritage Sites (listed & designated)   Process This is how I made this map, but not exactly what I’d do next time. See note below. download csv files from the City of Windsor Site refine data using Excel* (see note below): columns were in different order on different spreadsheets, not all included all columns, added data type and icon type. import all spreadsheets into Google Fusion Tables modify data to recognize lat & long coordinates as Location Visualize map to view the data points on GoogleMaps. Embed map in blog. Share! *Next time I plan to use Google Refine to clean the data. Working across multiple spreadsheets was a pain. Total time to make the map: 30 mins.
