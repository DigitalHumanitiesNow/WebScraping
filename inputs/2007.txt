The digital books revolution has left behind scholars working with ancient Greek: the most important impediments to digitizing polytonic Greek have been the lack of a high-quality optical character recognition for this script, especially under open-source licenses, and an assisted editor for polytonic Greek proof-reading. We present a integrated system that fills these critical gaps, making it possible for polytonic Greek texts to be digitized en masse by Rigaudon OCR, a complete suite of scripts, python code and data required for producing polytonic Greek OCR. The output provided by Rigaudon OCR is post-processed and piped to the CoPhiProofReader web application.
