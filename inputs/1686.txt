For Immediate Release Contact: info @ maryflanagan.com AprilÂ 14, 2015 (Hanover, NH) – From the game lab that brought you Awkward MomentÂ® comes a hilarious new party game, designed this time to let the adults in on the awkwardness! Today, Tiltfactor Laboratory is excited to announce the release of our newest card game, Awkward Moment at Work. Listen, weâve all been there. Embarrassing slips of the tongue, wardrobe malfunctions, secret (and not-so-secret) workplace romances, accidental emails, bathroom mishaps, copy room shenanigans. With Awkward Moment at Work, players are thrown into these awkward situations and more. During gameplay, players take turns assuming the role of the Decider, and each round, the Decider reveals a Moment Card that describes a hysterical, embarrassing, or stressful situation for the group to react to, and a Decider Card that provides a guideline for choosing a winning Reaction. Players submit a Reaction Card from their hand face down, and the Decider reads the submissions and selects the Reaction Card that he/she thinks is the best response to the Moment, given the Decider Cardâs rule. Awkward Moment at Work builds on the success of the original, award-winning Awkward Moment, the 3-8 player party game for kids and teens, substituting the chaos of the classroom for the (more professional) chaos of the workplace. Although the game targets adults, rest assured that itâs as family friendly as its predecessor. Awkward Moment at Work was developed as part of a National Science Foundation-funded project called âTransforming Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) For Women and Girls: Reworking Stereotypes & Bias.â The grant has allowed Tiltfactor, with additional assistance from the National Girls Collaborative Project, to research and create a number of games, with designs informed by psychological theory and research, aimed at reducing gender bias and broadening participation in STEM. The team offered a sneak preview of Awkward Moment at Work at Toy Fair 2015 in New York City and will be sold through Uncommon Goods, NYC.
