I recently presented on wearable computing in my Emerging Technologies class, and wow, what amazing things are on the horizon in this field. From the Nike+ running shoes to smart tattoos that can monitor your heart to chemical sensors printed on underwear that can detect wounds in soldiers and administer medication. How will wearable computing devices be used in libraries? The SixthSense device created at MIT illustrates whatÂ  might be ahead for wearable computing in libraries and how it could dramatically change the way we interact with information in our environment. Check out my presentation and the SixthSense demo below.Wearable Computing on Prezi
