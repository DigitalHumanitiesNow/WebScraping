After nine years on Blogger, I've ported all my posts to http://techist.mcclurken.org/.   I moved because I'm working to consolidate my digital identity (as part of UMW's Domain of One's Own project) and because almost all of my blogging in the classroom has been oriented around WordPress.So, if you're still following me here, please switch your feed to the new site (http://techist.mcclurken.org/feed).  [And look for a new post there with some news in the near future.]
