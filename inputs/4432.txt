 Another âdigitalâ thing Iâve been doing that relates to the âhumanitiesâ (but is it even remotely DH? I donât know), is the creation of research guides for digital resources in Japanese studies of all kinds, with a focus on Japanese-language free websites and databases, and open-access publications. So far, Iâve been working hard on creating guides for electronic Japanese studies resources, and mobile apps easily accessible in the US for both Android and iOS that relate to Japanese research or language study. The digital resources guide covers everything from general digital archives and citation indexes to literature, art, history, pop culture, and kuzushiji resources (for reading handwritten pre- and early modern documents). They range from text and image databases to dictionaries and even YouTube videos and online courseware for learning classical Japanese and how to read manuscripts. This has been a real challenge, as you can imagine. Creating lists of stuff is one thing (and is one thing Iâve done for Japanese text analysis resources), but actually curating them and creating the equivalent of annotated bibliographies is quite another. Itâs been a huge amount of research and writing â both in discovery of sources, and also in investigating and evaluating them, then describing them in plain terms to my community. I spent hours on end surfing the App and Play Stores and downloading/trying countless awful free apps â so you donât have to! Itâs especially hard to find digital resources in ways other than word of mouth. I find that I end up linking to other librariansâ LibGuides (i.e. research guides) often because theyâve done such a fantastic job curating their own lists already. I wonder sometimes if weâre all just duplicating each otherâs efforts! The NCC has a database of research guides, yes, but would it be better if we all collaboratively edited just one? Would it get overwhelming? Would there be serious disagreements about how to organize, whether to include paid resources (and which ones), and where to file things? The answer to all these questions is probably yes, which creates problems. Logistically, we canât have every Japanese librarian in the English-speaking world editing the same guide anyway. So itâs hard to say what the solution is â keep working in our silos? Specialize and tell our students and faculty to Google âLibGuide Japaneseâ + topic? (Which is what Iâve done in the past with art and art history.) Search the master NCC database? Some combination is probably the right path. Until then, I will keep working on accumulating as many kuzushiji resources as I can for Pennâs reading group, and updating my mobile app guide if I ever find a decent ã¾ã¨ã!
