In Sunday’s forthcoming NY Times.  I can’t talk much (or really at all on the phone) but I can answer questions over email.  The conversation was considerably longer than the quote, of course, but I am interested in the idea of the web as a more or less silent medium that is punctuated by sound.  All this technological innovation and it turns out the sound part is still pretty annoying.  If you don’t believe me, try turning on all the sonic prompts in Microsoft Office and see if you get any work done.
