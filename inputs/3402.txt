In honor of the 2012 Day of Digtal Archives, I am posting a link to the UNESCO/UBC Vancouver Declaration. This is the product of the recent Memory of the World in the Digital Age conference and they are looking for feedback on this declaration by October 19th, 2012 (see link on the conference page for sending in feedback). To give you a better sense of the aim of this conference, here are the ‘conference goals’ from the programme: The safeguard of digital documents is a fundamental issue that touches everyone, yet most people are unaware of the risk of loss or the magnitude of resources needed for long-term protection. This Conference will provide a platform to showcase major initiatives in the area while scaling up awareness of issues in order to find solutions at a global level. Ensuring digital continuity of content requires a range of legal, technological, social, financial, political and other obstacles to be overcome. The declaration itself is only four pages long and includes recommendations to UNESCO, member states and industry. If you are concerned with digital preservation and/or digitization, please take a few minutes to read through it and send in your feedback by October 19th. This post is from from: Spellbound Blog.UNESCO/UBC Vancouver Declaration
