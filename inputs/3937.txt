The THATCamp Council met today and ratified an anti-harassment policy based on the one pioneered by the Geek Feminism community. We are requiring every new THATCamp to agree to adopt the policy, and we hope that existing THATCamps will agree to adopt it as well. Weâ€™ll soon be integrating the policy into every new THATCamp site, as well.Thanks, all, for helping us keep THATCamp a safe, welcoming, and fun environment for all.
