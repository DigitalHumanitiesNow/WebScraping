The Text Creation Partnership is quickly arriving at a major milestone: starting January 1, 2015, all restrictions will be lifted from EEBO-TCP Phase I, which consists of the first 25,000 texts transcribed and encoded by the TCP from 2000-2009. These 25,000 (plus a few hundred) texts will be freely available to anyone wishing to use them, and there will no longer be any restrictions on sharing these files. They will be licensed under the Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication (CC0 1.0 Universal), which will be indicated in the header of each text. But what does this news mean for users of the EEBO-TCP Phase I texts? On January 1: If you already have a local version of the raw EEBO-TCP Phase I SGML or XML files, or derivative files that you have created from these, you may copy, post, publish, distribute, and otherwise share these files without restriction and without seeking special permission. If you are already hosting the EEBO-TCP Phase I texts online in a platform that has previously restricted access to them (for example, PhiloLogic@NU), you may at any time remove the access restrictions and make this resource available to the public. However, you are not required to do this. You may download the full corpus of EEBO-TCP Phase I files, as produced by the Text Creation Partnership, from box.com. Beginning January 1, anyone may âjoinâ the folder on box.com and download the files. Thanks to the efforts of James Cummings, Sebastian Rahtz, Magdalena Turska, and Martin Wynne at the University of Oxford, each of the texts will be available as HTML, ePUB, and TEI P5 XML via the Oxford Text Archive.  The week of January 5: When the University of Michigan re-opens from its holiday break, we will open up public access to the EEBO-TCP Phase I texts Â on our platform, which makes it possible to do targeted full-text searching across the entire corpus. Keep an eye out for announcements from Michigan Oxford, and ProQuest about this milestone.  All the time: It is important to remember that this public release applies only to the electronic texts created by the TCPÂ in its first phase of work. The facsimile page images that go along with each text will still be available only to users who have access to EEBO or the JISC Historical Texts platform. If you are affiliated with an institution that has access to the EEBO database and was an EEBO-TCP Phase I partner, nothing about your EEBO access will change: you will still be able to access the TCP texts via EEBO and search the texts in the same way you have been doing for years. For the time being, the EEBO-TCP Phase II texts are still available only to users at Phase II partner institutions.  Thanks and Acknowledgements This is a really exciting moment for the TCP, one that all those involved with the project have been looking forward to for many years. This project has been truly an international team effort, and though weâll certainlyÂ fall short in thanking each of our literally hundreds of partners and contributors, weâd like to try to acknowledge key supporters and contributors: First and foremost, credit and thanks go the more than 160 supporting libraries whose faith in this unique partnership model and investment in this initiative made the whole thingÂ possible. This effort would also not have been possible without the support and cooperation of ProQuest, the company that imagined and built EEBO. ProQuestâs support–both financial and practical–allowed this unique public and private partnership to thrive. Likewise, we thank JISC and JISC Collections for their contributions and efforts on behalf of libraries and users across the UK. Our vendors, including over the years Apex CoVantage, Spi Global, Aptara, and AELD, and Â especially their teams of developers, taggers, keyers, and managers based in Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Manila and elsewhere, who actually transcribed each text, delivering batches of hundreds of texts each month back to Michigan and Oxford for editorial review. The teams of full- and part-time editors, project managers, librarians, and others–more than 90 in all!–at the University of Michigan Library and the University of Oxford Bodleian Library Digital Systems and Services. Finally, we thank the super-users, the champions, and our colleagues at Michigan, Oxford and elsewhere who maintain the systems where the texts are hosted, indexed, and made available for use. This long list includes, among others: Maria Bonn (former head of MPublishing, Michigan) Richard Gartner (Oxford Digital Library) Bill Gosling (former UL, Michigan) Kat Hagedorn (projects librarian, DLPS, Michigan) Alexander Huber (Oxford Digital Library) Martin Mueller (Northwestern) Richard Ovenden (Bodley’s Librarian, Oxford) Dafydd Alwyn Owen (Llyfrgell Genedlaethol Cymru) Chris Powell (text services, DLPS, Michigan) Dave Price (former head of SERS, Oxford) Sebastian Rahtz (Oxford IT Services) Mark Sandler (former head of collections, Michigan) Bryan Skib (head of collections, Michigan) Cory Snavely, (Core Services, Michigan) John Wilkin (former AUL, Michigan) Brian Pytlik Zillig (Nebraska)  We wish you very happy holidays and look forward to all that 2015Â has in store–starting with January 1.
