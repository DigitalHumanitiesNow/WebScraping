FormÂ .txtLAB intern and current undergraduate RA, Fedor Karmanov, presented his experience as an Arts Research Intern last summer to an audience of over 200 students and faculty last night at a packed event showcasing undergraduate research. As FedorÂ described his experience, heÂ spent the summer learning about data collection and analysis and taught himself in the process two programming languages (R and Python). His final project was a study of novelty in English poetry in the 20C. Pulling together a corpus of 60,000 poems, Fedor explored how we might understand literary innovation and whether it exhibits a recognizable time-frame that matches received critical wisdom about British modernism. Fedor is now a senior RA with the lab, working on new projects and helping to supervise incoming interns.
