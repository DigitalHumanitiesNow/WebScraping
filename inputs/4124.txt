The complete series of the Calendar of State Papers, Spain is now live. There are 19 volumes in all, covering the period from the accession of Henry VII to the death of Mary I.  The calendar gives a summary, with extensive quotation, of the official papers of the Spanish court which relate to England and English affairs. Highlights include first-hand coverage of how the marriage of Mary to Philip II of Spain was viewed from a Spanish perspective, and, of course, the alarm and diplomatic activity surrounding the eclipse of Henry VIIIâ€™s Spanish queen, Katherine, and the corresponding rise of Anne Boleyn. The Elizabethan papers can be found in the complementary Simancas series which is already live on the site. Both series are being made available free, as part of the AHRC-funded project to complete the digitisation of the calendars of state papers.
