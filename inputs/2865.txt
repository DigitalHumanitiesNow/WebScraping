I can’t quite say “terrible, horrible” because I did get some homework done, which included a very interesting documentary. But still, I have decided that I Do Not Like May 23, 2013. Why? Because: my sister’s flight was delayed 2 hours (from 7pm to 9pm, waiting with a small child) and then cancelled. an unproductive meeting which added another appointment to my schedule a sudden thunderstorm combined with poor landscaping caused the front ‘porch’ of my basement flat to flood, which leaked into my flat. only about an inch, and only about 10 feet into the house, but. Running around in cold rain in a thunderstorm in bare feet is Cold! and a bit scary! In short: May 23, begone! I have no use for you!
