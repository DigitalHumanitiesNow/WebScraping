 Here’s last night’s casseroles protest in our neighbourhood.  We walked down to Beaubien last night and ran into a bunch of friends.  I guess “Villeray dÃ©sobÃ©is” is the place to be. My attendance this week will be a little spotty–there’s a lot of music stuff going on with MUTEK right around 8pm, but perhaps I will catch some of it downtown.
