Two big stories dominate this edition of the podcast: the rejection of the Google Books settlement and the request for a professor’s personal email. Tom, Mills, Amanda, and Dan discuss why the settlement between Google and the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers didn’t pass muster, and what the ramifications of the ruling are. We also look in-depth at what it means to have an university-provided email address given the Wisconsin GOP’s request to gain access to William Cronon’s email messages. On a lighter note, the Digital Campus team tries to decide if the addition of OMG and LOL to the OED spells the end of civilization. [Editor’s Note: We recorded this podcast on 3/31/11, before the resolution of the Cronon affair.] Additional links mentioned on the podcast:‘Academic Freedom’ Offers Little Protection Against New Efforts to Obtain Professors’ E-MailsTyler Cowen’s Ethnic Dining Guide Running time: 50:05 Download the .mp3        Two big stories dominate this edition of the podcast: the rejection of the Google Books settlement and the request for a professor’s personal email.
