On October 30th I posted my 100th tweet, now 2 months later on December 26th,Â  I reached the 200th tweet. When I reached tweet number 100 I posted a Wordle diagram with the subjects of my last 100 posts, now at number 200 I will do the same. What have I done in the last months, and what have been my areas of interest? I believe that twitter is a good way to find that out. So I created the wordle again, with the 150 most used words.  It is clear from seeing the diagram that GIS, MOOC, dataviz, and infographics have been main subjects. The teacher of the MOOC Alberto Cairo, that I have retweeted a lot is also very prominent. A term that is missing is web design, also the pizza that was more prominent from my food blogs last time do not make it to the most used 150 words. On the other hand a term that is special for this time of year and got listed is “Santa” this due to the wonderful Norad Santa tracker and the Google Maps interface. All in all, a good overview, and now on my way to tweet #300
