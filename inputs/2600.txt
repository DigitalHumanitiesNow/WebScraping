I’m pleased to announce that Willard McCarty and I are leading a two-year set of summer institutes in digital humanities at the National Humanities Center. Here is the official announcement:  “The first of the National Humanities Centerâs summer institutes in digital humanities, devoted to digital textual studies, will convene for two one-week sessions, first in June 2015 and again in 2016. The objective of the Institute in Digital Textual Studies is to develop participantsâ technological and scholarly imaginations and to combine them into a powerful investigative instrument. Led by Willard McCarty (Kingâs College London and University of Western Sydney) and Matthew Jockers (University of Nebraska), the Institute aims to further the development of individual as well as collaborative projects in literary and textual studies. The Institute will take place in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, in 2015 and at the National Humanities Center in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, in 2016.” The first workshop will take place June 8 – 12.  Applications are now open.  See  http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/digital-humanities/application.html
