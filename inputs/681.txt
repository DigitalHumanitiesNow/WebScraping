April’s Faculty Fellows Forum will feature Elizabeth Lorang, Leen-Kiat Soh, Joe Lunde, and Grace Thomas presenting on “Detecting Poetic Content in Historic Newspapers with Image Analysis.” This presentation will discuss the development of a software system for image processing to aid in the automated identification of poetic content in the 7 million newspaper pages available from Chronicling America. After establishing a context and rationale for this work, the presentation will demonstrate our work in progress to identify poetic content in digitized newspapers. We will conclude with a look at lessons learned thus far, next steps, and broader implications of this research. Please join us Tuesday, April 1,Â  from 3.30-5.00 in Love Library 111.
