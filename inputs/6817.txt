Time to review the year. So, who inspired me this year and what recommendations - for books to read, blogs and folks to follow - should you check out?  Note: These are all my personal choices relating to my professional life and thus deeply partial with no attempt at objectivity... if you wish to add your own suggestions then please feel free to add comments.    Favourite Books I Read in 2013
