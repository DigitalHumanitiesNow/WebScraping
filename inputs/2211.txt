An excerpt from Matthew Battles’s and myÂ The Library Beyond the Book was published inÂ today’s online edition of the Future Tense section ofÂ Slate, entitled “The Accumulibrary. Forget the Dewey Decimal System, Libraries Should be Lawless.” (The neologism is ours; the title is of Slate‘s devising.) The chapter in question, far from providing a cross-section of our book’s larger argument,Â stands apart as aÂ willfully speculative, fictional, and Â polemical scenario, preceded and followed byÂ a diversity of other not-so-speculative, historically grounded scenarios, regarding the library’s future as a socio-cultural institution.Â This in a book whose overarching theme is the need for a variety of innovative, well-designed, imaginative, sensorially rich physical environments for knowledge sharing, pleasure, rumination, and research. TheÂ Slate onlineÂ comments stream, somewhat inevitably, rises to the chapter’s polemical bait and fails to intuit the book’s broader claims: that browsing and serendipitous encounters remain fundamental toÂ processes of discovery; thatÂ social reading in shared spaces is just as important today as it was in the respective eras of Cassiodorus and Erasmus; that every scheme of organization, from Callimachus to Dewey and beyond, is a historical construct shaped by a given set of cultural and social beliefs; that data are not simply given or disembodied, but constructed and embodied. In short,Â The Library Beyond the BookÂ is engaged in advocacy on two overlappingÂ fronts: for innovation as regards the need for new library typologies based upon those that history has provided us; and for continuity as regards affirming the library’s enduring value as a place of gathering and communion between people, space, and information.
