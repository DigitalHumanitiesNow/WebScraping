My latest paperÂ is out with ADA: A Journal of Gender, New Media and Technology. This paper began with a discussion on Twitter, transitioned to a blog post here, morphed into an empirical question in comment sections and finally became what it is presently, i.e. a paper about academic capitalism + attention economies + structural marginality. What is it? Why do we do it? And with what means and to what ends do we do it? But, before I thought about theory I started with a question: why didn’t I have many rape threats?* Other women who write publicly get a lot of rape threats. I could not remember getting very many, if any at all. I remembered that I had a blog. That blog had a lot of my public writing, complete with comments and metadata. After some extracted and cleaning, I started by resolving my memory problem: there weren’t any rapeÂ threats. I had plenty of racism. And, then I had this other stuff. I started by trying to figure out what that stuff was. The larger project is a comparative case study of various public facing textual accounts and is on-going. Want to volunteer your content for the study??? Please email me and remember that research karma is real. *One commenter did suggest that I am too ugly to copulate with and I allow that as a confounding variable. For science.
