Here is the new home page for my portfolio.  It brings together many of my works but also Twitter and the blogs where I regularly post.   Upcoming, “a show of hands: las hermanas de la palma,” the play adaptation of my online hypertext novella will be read at Repertorio Espanol at 6:30pm on  December 14th in New York City.  You can read the novella here.  This marks the latest development in the play, which previously had a staged reading at Loyola Marymount University.  My students are working on a new project called @Wall Watch in response to the tragedy of Tyler Clementi at Rutgers. Up next, MLA in Los Angeles. Come see the panels!
