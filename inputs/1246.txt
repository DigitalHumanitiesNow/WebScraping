This book takes up a possible (negative) aspect of digital technology in terms of privacy and democracy. TO SAVE EVERYTHING, CLICK HERE: The Folly of Technological Solutionism, by Evgeny Morozov Imagine a world in which humanityâequipped with powerful self-tracking devicesâfinally conquers obesity, insomnia, and global warming as everyone eats less, sleeps better, and emits more appropriately. The fallibility of human memory is conquered, as the very same tracking devices record and store everything we do. Car keys, faces, factoids: we will never forget them again. No need to feel nostalgic, since that moment is surely stored somewhere in your smartphoneâor, more likely, your smart, all-recording glassesâyou can stop fantasizing and simply rewind to it directly. Politics is freed from all the sleazy corruption, backroom deals, and inefficient horse trading. Parties are disaggregated and replaced by Groupon-like political campaigns, where users come togetherâonceâto weigh in on issues of direct and immediate relevance to their lives, only to disband shortly afterward. And even those whoâve never bothered to vote in the past are finally provided with the right incentives and so they rush to use their smartphones to âcheck inâ at the voting booth. Crime is a distant memory, while courts are overstaffed and underworked and prisons are unnecessary. Both physical and virtual environmentsâwalls, pavements, doors, log-in screensâhave become âsmart.â That is, they have integrated the plethora of data generated by the self-tracking devices and social-networking services so that now they can predict and prevent criminal behavior simply by analyzing their users. Newspapers no longer publish articles that their readers are not interested in; the proliferation of self-tracking combined with social-networking data guarantees that everyone gets to read a highly customized newspaper that yields the highest possible click rate. No story goes unclicked, no headline untweeted; customized, individual articles are generated in the few seconds that pass between the click of a link and the loading of the page in oneâs browser. While there are many in Silicon Valley who subscribe to an âinternet-solutionismâ ideology and find such a technology-driven utopia enticing, Morozov finds this sort of future terrifying. He argues: âSilicon Valleyâs quest to fit us all into a digital straightjacket by promoting efficiency, transparency, certitude and perfectionâand, by extension, eliminating their evil twins of friction, opacity, ambiguity, and imperfectionâwill prove to be prohibitively expensive in the long run.
