By now, you’ll have heard – perhaps via international media, or on Twitter or Facebook – about the protests that started in defence of one of Istanbul’s last remaining green spaces, and have now, in response to heavy-handed policing and broader worries about democratic rights,Â spread across many cities in Turkey.Â  I’ve been following theÂ torrent of communication and coverage on Twitter mainly via a mixture of local and international academics, NGO people and journalists – ranging fromÂ Asli TunÃ§, Yaman Akdeniz, Zeynep TufekciÂ (who has also blogged a rapid, excellent analysis), andÂ Burcu BaykurtÂ [UPDATE: Burcu has written a very comprehensive post detailing the main media reform issues emerging from the Gezi Park protest movement] toÂ Aaron Stein,Â Benjamin Harvey, Hugh Pope and Amberin ZamanÂ – as well as feeds like 140 Journos. (Feel free to tweet me or @mediapolicyÂ with further suggestions.) One of the most widely discussed (on Twitter) aspects of these protests has been the mainstream Turkish media’s perceived failure to cover the protests fairly, adequately, or in some cases at all, leading Bloomberg’s Benjamin Harvey toÂ tweetÂ the following: Turks being confronted with the now-undeniable deficiencies of their media may be one of the most important aspects of these protests. In report after report after reportÂ [UPDATE: 3 June 2013 – see comment below for further resources], those deficiencies – and the reasons for them – have been thoroughly, exhaustively anatomised. Asli TunÃ§ and Vehbi GÃ¶rgÃ¼lÃ¼’sÂ Mapping Digital Media Turkey report (2012), for example, gives a very comprehensive overview of the Turkish media sector and its travails, and is part of a 50-country series that mediapolicy.org readers know well. TheÂ Carnegie report (also supported by OSF) by Marc Pierini and Markus MayrÂ on Press Freedom in Turkey, takes a different approach. Introducing the report in January 2013, Pierini wrote: I didnât conduct yet another inquiry into press freedom. More modestly, I analyzed all the reports published on the subject by governmental and non-governmental, Turkish and foreign entities during the last two years. Although they had different focuses and methodologies, all these reports convey one single image: Turkeyâs record is bad because it fares well below the countryâs democratic credentials and is hurting the nation economically and diplomatically on the international scene. One has to hope that the Gezi Park crisisÂ will lead in some way to genuine reforms in Turkey’s media policy and media sector, freeing journalism to play a stronger role in the country’s democracy.Â As Turkey is one of mediapolicy.org‘s focus countries, we’ll definitely follow developments and build up useful resources over the coming weeks and months.Â We’d love to hear from academics, researchers, civil society and journalists interested in sharing perspectives on media policy and reform in Turkey – please get in touchÂ on emailÂ orÂ Twitter.Â Filed under: Policy, Law & Regulation Tagged: #gezipark, censorship, demokrasi, feature, featured, gazetecilik, iyi yÃ¶netiÅim, media policy, media reform, mediapolicy.org, medya politikasÄ±, Press freedom, protest, report, research, self-censorship, Turkey, turkiye, twitter, yayÄ±n
