For the London Fringe Festival’s Nuit Blanch event last week, Chris McInnis and others played Katamari Damacy  projected on a brick wall and using a giant katamari-shaped motion-controller that you actually roll like a really big track ball.    (Apparently a good deal of excellent cosplay was involved, as well.) This combination of DIY fabrication (using an Arduino board), social gaming out on the street, and motion-control haptic play seems perfect for Keita Takahashi’s 2004 art game, which thematizes gameplay as collecting, simply rolling up, all the things in the world. This inspired hack remakes the game as a kind of Augmented-Reality experience.“My, Earth really is full of things!”–as the King of All Cosmos says in the game.   (via BoingBoing)
