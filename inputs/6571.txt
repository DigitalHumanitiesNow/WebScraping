“We will make electricity so cheap that only the rich will burn candles.” -Thomas Edison Almost 20 years before Thomas Edison invented the incandescent light bulb in 1879, this week’s Old Book was published.Â Natural Philosophy For The Use of Teachers and Schools was published in Dublin, Ireland in 1860.
