Early modern and modern gravestones are a vast but rapidly decaying historical resource. Weathering, damage, and re-use have all affected the size and scholarly value of this material. There are no agreed standards for recording and publishing gravestones, and recording is fragmentary and inconsistent. However, many of the standards used in the digital publication of Classical and Medieval inscriptions are applicable to modern gravestones: this paper investigates whether they provide a viable method of recording such a large body of data, where the researchers are often not experts in epigraphy, and solutions are suggested for designing a pilot project.
