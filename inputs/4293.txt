  Photo by Peter Leonard 19 June 2012 | Young Research Library, UCLA For the next two+ weeks, I’ll be out in Los Angeles, attending the NEH Seminar on Digital Cultural Mapping, hosted by Diane Favro, Chris Johansen and Tod Presner. We’ll be in class every day, learning about DH (Digital Humanities) projects and tools and working on our own projects. I’ll be posting intermittently from the seminar on a variety of topics from developing robust geo-spatial arguments, pressuring the academic world to accept DH projects for tenure, sustainability and digital projects, using DH in the classroom, among other topics.  In honor of moving into the next phase of the Mapping the Green Book project, I’ve opened up a Twitter Feed @GreenBookMaps so that I can better keep track of my colleagues in DH around the globe.
