As the crew from Digital Campus have already announced, Dave Lester and I published our first episode of our new podcast, THATPodcast. The first show focused on WordPress, and included an interview with Matt Mullenweg, the creator of WordPress, and a screencast covering our plugin ScholarPress Courseware.  Even though I had taken a digital history documentary class a few years ago, it still surprised me how much work creating a podcast involved. Like Dave, though, I'm pretty happy with what we came up with, despite getting a little rushed. Dave did a lot of work at the end, so most of the credit for the success of the first show should go to him. Thanks, Dave.  Our plan is to roll out a new THATPodcast show once a month. In February our show will cover Omeka, the free, open source platform for managing collections and exhibits now in development at the Center for History and New Media. We're going to time episode two with the public release of Omeka, so be sure to check back next month!
