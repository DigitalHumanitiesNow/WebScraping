“We agreed on the important role a free and independent media should play in Somalia, and welcomed the Federal Governmentâs commitment to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the killing of journalists, and to promote press freedom.” (Somalia Conference 2013: Official CommuniquÃ© at GOV.UK.) Yesterday’s conference communiquÃ© was unambiguous on the need to protect the media in Somalia. Here’s a selection of the international groups working on media policy issues in Somalia, and a couple of recent reports about the media environment in the country – let us know via the comments what we’re missing, and we’ll update the list. – EU fact sheet from Dec 2012 detailing some of the activities of the Somalia Media Support Group of donors, NGOs, and international organisations, and insights into the future strategy for supporting Somalia’s media sector to 2015– CIMA‘s compilation of where Somalia sits in various international press freedom rankings– Somalia sits in 2nd position in the CPJ’s Impunity Index for killings of journalists– Article 19 has been tracking the development of Somalia’s media law, and recently held aÂ conference on protection of journalists in Mogadishu– the BBC’s media development arm,Â BBC Media Action, produced aÂ media environment analysisÂ and aÂ policy briefing about the role of the mediaÂ in 2011– the InfoAsAid project we featured a couple of weeks ago includes a pretty comprehensive Somalia media/telecoms landscape report from early 2012Â (also here) – the Center for Law and Democracy published a media law and policy review for Somalia in late 2012 (here’s a piece from Albany Associates about the report)–Â Albany AssociatesÂ is also supporting the government and the UN’s AMISOM more broadly on communications– NORAGRIC is a less usual source for media landscape information, but here’s their March 2012 report on Somalia– Danish NGO IMS supports a Somali radio station,Â Radio Ergo– Global Voices covers Somalia with reasonable regularity, as has the Guardian‘s Data Blog And finally, here are some stats on social media usage in Somalia, courtesy of Social Bakers.Filed under: Policy, Law & Regulation Tagged: africa, featured, Horn of Africa, Impunity, journalists safety, Media Law, mediapolicy.org, politics, Press freedom, report, Somalia, UK
