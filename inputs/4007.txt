At the New Republic, Susan Schulten has a fascinating article about maps made by Richard Edes Harrison during World War II. Schulten writes that Harrison, an artist and not a cartographer, changed the American publicâs perception of the war and world by refusing to use the Mercator projection. Instead, he drew maps from various perspectives above the earth, evoking âthe perspective of a pilot, but one placed at an infinite distance.â   Figure 1: Richard Edes Harrison, âEurope as Viewed from the U.S.S.R.â (1944).

[H]is goal was to wrench Americans out of a two-dimensional sense of geography, and embrace an understanding of perspective and direction.  Much of maps that historians make on the web is also limited by the Mercator projection. Google Maps, Stamen, and Map Box all use a âWeb Mercatorâ projection for the tiles they provide. If youâve used a web map that pans and zooms, it was almost certainly created in the Mercator projection. Even if there are good technical reasons for Google to use that projection, historians have their own purposes that could be better served by alternative perspectives on the earth.

[PNG] According to Schulten, Harrison never thought of himself as a cartographer, and âcartographers were quick to point out that no such perspective existed in nature.â But thanks to the work of Mike Bostock and Jason Davies, the kinds of perspectives that Harrison used are available to web mapmakers.1 As part of the geographic projections available in D3, Bostock has created a satellite projection, with which the mapmaker can control the view of the earth as from a camera mounted on satellite. Such a map could be combined with any of the visualization techniquesâchoropleth shading, bubble maps, place namesâfor which D3 is known.

[PNG] This means that historians have the tools they need to re-imagine their historical maps outside of the constraints of any particular map projection.3 Just as Harrison changed the public view of the geopolitical situation with his perspective maps, so historians would have a powerful imaginative and rhetorical tool at their disposal if they could choose the perspective of their maps. One can imagine, for example, a map that redraws the Atlantic slave trade from the perspective of West Africa, or a map that literally faces east from Indian country. As is often the case when I read Schultenâs work, the historical maps she studies provide a useful suggestion for how historians could make their own maps to imagine the past.
