We love a growing team. Lately the DC team has been on a bit of a growth binge. We’re excited that Erich Rainville is joining up! Heâs a local VA Designer/Developer (or âUnicornâ) who has a long history of designing the web. Erichâs worked as a Graphic Designer and Senior Developer, and heâll be joining us on our Open Data project. Weâll be leveraging his skills to enhance our User Experience, design and overall application look and feel. Erich Point of Rocks, MD When Erichâs not out romping through various National Forests (he loves to backpack) heâll be in our DC office making all the things pretty and, more importantly, usable and exciting. Weâre stoked to have Erich on board.
