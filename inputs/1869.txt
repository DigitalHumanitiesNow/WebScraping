In the absence of Amanda French, Dan, Tom, Mills and Stephen were assisted by only two Amandas. Â Tom and Stephen kicked off this podcast with a discussion of new rules for the electronic management of government records and the implications of these new rules for transparency and historical access. Â We then heard Dan’s thoughts on the Open Syllabus Project, which resulted in a discussion about how educators share or borrow from each others syllabi. Â One of the questions raised was whether or not syllabus writers can claim copyright over their content, which segued nicely into a discussion of Blackboard’s new open source policies. Â Our group noted open sourced does not necessarily mean open access. Â Finally, the group celebrated the first birthday of the Digital Public Library of America and congratulated Dan on its success.
