Dan Cohen, the Director of Research Projects at CHNM, has put together a Google Map of New York at approximately 9:00AM on September 11, 2001.  For the fourth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, we have selected photographs and stories from Ground Zero in New York, and overlaid them on an interactive map. Clicking on blue markers (photos) or red markers (stories) shows details from the September 11 Digital Archive.    The map includes points that, when clicked, draw images and stories from the September 11 Digital Archive. See the images below:
