If youâre responsible for departmental or institutional budgets and feel like giving yourself a shock, consider the true cost of face-to-face meetings.                    With everything factored in - the loss of productivity while people travel to and fro, the travel costs, refreshments, incidental expenses and possibly overnight accommodation - it really mounts up.Rethinking videoconferencingOver the years there have been lots of studies trying to identify an average hourly cost per person per meeting, but – in spite of the scary figures they came up with - there were always people who didn’t like the videoconferencing alternative. They saw it as requiring meticulous planning and often a specialist person to get the technology working smoothly. Or they felt that the personal touch was lost in the scramble to connect technology and rooms.[#pullquote#]we’ve developed an interface that naturally puts people and their conversations back at the centre of the process[#endpullquote#]So now, we’ve rethought the whole process and developed an interface that naturally puts people and their conversations back at the centre of the process - even if the participants are communicating over a video link.Keeping it personalWhen people are working in isolated pockets across a geographical area it’s the human aspect of the interaction that matters most. The Scottish Universities Physics Alliance (SUPA) is a group of postgraduates studying aspects of physics at the eight Scottish universities. With only a handful of students at each university, some have found themselves quite isolated from most of their peers both socially and collaboratively.[#pullquote#]it’s the human aspect of the interaction that matters most[#endpullquote#]To overcome that isolation they are using video technologies to create a community of their own, enrich teaching and learning and pool the learning resources of their lecture recordings in their shared virtual learning environment (VLE). They have migrated all this successfully onto our recently launched Vscene service.Vscene - our videoconferencing service[[{"fid":"2522","view_mode":"default","type":"media","attributes":{"height":"234","width":"350","alt":"Vscene","class":"media-element file-default media--left"}}]]Vscene enables SUPA to maintain a regular programme of meetings and lectures at set times and now it also makes it much easier for group members to connect very informally. Its user-friendly, self-service system guides people through set-up whether they want to fulfil a scheduled booking between suitably equipped meeting rooms or make an ad hoc call from their laptop. It takes a handful of mouse clicks using familiar web tools.Personal preferencesEven in its more informal mode, where a quick video conversation replaces a telephone call, it can transform the way people interact for work and for social reasons.The person who instigates the contact doesn’t need to know where the other person will be at a particular time, because each individual can enter their own preferences into the system. This means if they work from home on Wednesday mornings, that’s where the system will route the connection if they have a video call at that time.AdaptabilitySince video calls can ‘follow’ people in this way, what happens if one of the participants is in a place where internet connectivity is poor?  Historically, the answer would be that the meeting quality would be degraded for everyone, with video suffering from delays or even dropping out altogether.[#pullquote#]Vscene adapts, sending the right quality signal for the bandwidth each participant has[#endpullquote#]Vscene adapts, sending the right quality signal for the bandwidth each participant has: if you are on a slow and unreliable connection your video may look ‘blocky’ but it won’t freeze or stutter. And if the connection improves, so will the video quality. It is a smart feature that will be particularly valuable for mobile users when we add support for smartphone and tablet videoconferencing in the future.Visit us at DigifestSo if you haven’t seen Vscene for yourself yet, I hope you’ll visit us near the VW camper van at Digifest.This is a really exciting advance that enables us to overcome many of the reservations people have had about videoconferencing while also helping colleges and universities to save significant amounts of money and reduce their carbon footprint.Further informationThere is more about Vscene on the Janet website.This year’s Jisc Digital Festival takes place on 9 and 10 March at the International Convention Centre in Birmingham.
