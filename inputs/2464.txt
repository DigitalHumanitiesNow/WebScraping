In his Lecture on Ethics, Ludwig Wittgenstein says"If a man could write a book  on Ethics which really was a book on Ethics, this book would, with an explosion, destroy all the other books in the world."It strikes that Bernard Williams Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy has probably come the closest to making good on Wittgenstein's remark.
