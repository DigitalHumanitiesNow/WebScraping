 I’m excited to say that the electronic roundtable that Kathi Berens and I proposed for the 2012 MLA Convention has been accepted. The session grew out of proposals that were originally submitted to Kathy Harris‘s roundtable on digital pedagogy. She received so many great abstracts that she couldn’t include them all. Consequently she asked Kathi and I, who had separately sent her abstracts, if we would consider putting forward a session of our own using some of the abstracts that seemed thematically related. Something that’s interesting about MLA sessions is that one works very hard on the proposal to be something that speaks to the program committee, but that session proposal is then condensed into less than 200 words that will appear in the actual program. Such a process allows the session to change in the nine months following the proposal. The proposal becomes something of a lost document then. Maybe that’s not a bad thing. Who wants to read abstracts, after all, of sessions? But since this proposal reflects some significant intellectual labor on the part of Kathi and myself and because I like to make public those things that I write, I want to share our proposal for #MLA12. Feel free to print out a copy to read again and again. Building Digital Humanities in the Undergraduate Classroom: An Electronic Roundtable At  the âHistory and Future of Digital Humanitiesâ panel at the 2011 MLA, Stephen Ramsay discussed the perennial problem of defining what âcountsâ as work within the digital humanities. Taking what he knew would be a  provocative stance, Ramsay declared, âPersonally, I think Digital  Humanities is about building things. […I]f you are not making  anything, you are not […] a digital humanist.” This declaration incited  passionate debate in the weeks immediately following the Convention and  prompted Ramsay to clarify his remarks: âBuilding  is, for us, a new kind of hermeneutic â one that is quite a bit more  radical than taking the traditional methods of humanistic inquiry and  applying them to digital objects.â Building allows the maker to  look at an object, a text, or some piece of information anew, producing  discoveries that would not be found otherwise. The âradicalâ potential  of the digital humanities that Ramsay envisions is that building and  interpreting is a lapidary process: slicing facets of the same gem. Barriers  to participation in the digital humanities have lowered during the last  five years, as a handful of simple tools permit the creation of digital  artifacts that nevertheless yield significant opportunity for  interpretation. With a few rapid clicks of a mouse, a scholar can drop  descriptive markers into Bing Maps or plot points within Google Earth.  In a short time, one can create a rough map of Huckleberry Finnâs trip  down the Mississippi River or visualize the approximate size of the titular object in Donald Barthelmeâs story âThe Balloon,â acts that literally help you new things about the text. Indeed, the tools to map events and objects  are simple enough to be quickly introduced into the undergraduate  classroom. Such  ease of use is especially important in this context, where faculty  cannot assume that students have prior (or continued) technical  training: tools have to be simple to use so that the intellectual  endeavor can focus on the simultaneous and recursive practices of  building and interpreting. Undergraduates bring various digital skill  sets into the classroom, but their preparation as interpreters of text  is routinely underdeveloped. Through the act of building, students  create new vantage points from which to apply humanistic hermeneutics.  Whatâs more, since undergraduates are accustomed to consuming  information without assessing how media shapes their consumption,  building digital artifacts helps them perceive the literally built,  constructed nature of digital engagement. In  this digital roundtable, panelists will present undergraduate work that  has been created in response to assignments designed to foster the  building/interpretation feedback loop of the digital humanities in  undergraduates. The projects featured present a full range of technical  complexity: from low-barrier-to-entry platforms like woices (dropping  audio files on a Google map) to multimodal, geospatial timelines of key  years in American literary history, to a map of early modern London that students annotate encyclopedically, street-by-street. The  seventy-five minute session will begin with an overview of the  projects. Each presenter (or team of co-presenters) will show-and-tell  for five minutes. Then attendees will be free to circulate and review  the projects of most interest to them for half an hour. The intended  audience of this roundtable will include those with different vectors of  interest in the projects: novice-to-expert technical engagement;  collaboratively produced student projects or individually produced ones;  and the degree to which institutional support is required to do the  project. Â In the final ten minutes of the session, the co-presiders will  facilitate discussion among attendees. Attendees  of this digital roundtable will gain: 1) off-the-shelf assignments  vetted for optimal implementation, assessment, and desired learning  outcomes; and 2) an overview of the wide range of projects, from simple  to complex, that engage undergraduates in digital humanities praxis.  Implicitly, this roundtable sends the message that âbuilding stuffâ is  foundational to the digital humanities and, crucially, that the  technical barriers to participation can be very low. The ease of  clearing professional barriers to begin work in the digital humanities  is demonstrated by the diversity of our panelists: tenured and  tenure-track professors, a program director, post-docs, a graduate  student, librarian, an adjunct, and an E-Learning project manager.  Digital humanities veterans and novices alike will find projects at this  roundtable that build fresh insights about how they can stimulate both  collaborative construction and humanistic inquiry in their undergraduate  teaching.
