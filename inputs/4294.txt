the bronze buckaroo 6.8.2012 | at desk In the 1930s, Herb Jeffries and his backing group, the Four Tones, shot a number of westerns with all-black casts, includingÂ  Harlem on the Prairie (1937), Two-Gun Man from Harlem (1938), The Bronze Bukaroo (1939), and Harlem Ridges the Range (1939). All four of these films were shot at Murrayâs Dude Ranch, in Victorville, California, which is how I found myself watching The Bronze Buckaroo online today. Jeffries had a long career as a singer, actor, director, and stuntman and filmmaker, but his most well-known contributions are the many films he made as singing cowboyÂ "Bob Blake.âÂ  The Autry, a terrific museum in Griffith Park in Los Angeles, has a few items form Herb Jeffries career in their collections, but if you really want toÂ  understand his legacy, you should search out some of his films, many of which are posted on youtube. The quality is pretty abysmal, but the singing is great and you can catch glimpses of Murrayâs, now long-gone, which has a long and interesting history as an African American ranch resort, with a number of high profile guests from the entertainment industry.Â  If your interested in knowing (a very little) bit more about Murrayâs, the National Park Service has a brief history of Murrayâs online and there is a longer article published by KCET, with illustrations. If you want to watch the full movie, the kind folks at Internet Archive have posted the file for your viewing pleasure: The Bronze Buckaroo.Â
