The proceedings of the June 12-14, 2012 Paris conference on the translation of electronic literature are now online. These include a paper by Natalia Fedorova and myself, “Carrying across Language and Code.” The conference took place at UniversitÃ© Paris 8 Vincennes-Saint-Denis and UniversitÃ© Paris Diderot, and encouraged me and collaborators to undertake the Renderings project, the first phase of which is now onlne.
