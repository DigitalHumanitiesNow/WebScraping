ANTIBOOKCLUB, a new publishing (ad)venture out of Chicago, released its first book this fall, A Brief History of Authoterrorism. It's a sometimes funny, sometimes odd, always delightful anthology chronicling just how far authors will go to promote their work. I wrote a wee bit of aca-fiction for the book. It involves Leibniz's binary system, the history of copyright law and a rare book room OCR mystery. (Of course. What else would I write about?!)It's beautifully edited and designed by Gabriel Levinson. Do check it out, and support the project if you can.
