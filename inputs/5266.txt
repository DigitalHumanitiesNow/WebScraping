[Slide 1]: So, this is a very short part of my current book project on steampunk, nineteenth-century British literature, and the digital humanities. Overall that project is suggesting that steampunk offers a model for understanding how people are manipulating the nineteenth-century to speculate about possible or impossible alternate histories. I’m also interested in how our understanding of history is being transformed by computation, and suggest that the popularity of steampunk and alternate history is due in part to a growing transformation of temporality by non-human computational processes — along with how that manipulation is being registered on a cultural level. But I’ll get to that in a moment. [Slide 2]: Spoilers! Stay away if you don’t want to know the ending of Bioshock Infinite! [Slide 3]: Here are three quotes that are particularly important to this presentation. The bottom one is a central ideas of the field of media archaeology, namely that the history of media isn’t linear but also includes variant devices that disappeared or potential technological histories that we did experience for one reason or another. For the other two, we get two different versions of counterfactual or alternate history. Gallagher argues that counterfactual inquiry started in theological debates with Leibniz and in military campaigns. The idea was to understand experimental spaces for trying out different scenerios. The steampunk genre takes this up for fictional ends, but also for cultural and I’d argue technological experimentation. See Goh and Zielinski. [Slide 4]: The encounter with alternate history inÂ Bioshock Infinite is shaped by the character Elizabeth, who can create “tears” to parallel dimensions. Here is our first encounter with Elizabeth where she opens a portal to an alternate 1980s Paris. Of course, there’s lots of fan service with the depiction of the different dimensions in the game.Â Bioshock Infinite‘s game narrative is really complex, but basically revolves around Booker DeWitt trying to rescue Elizabeth from her father Zachery Comstock — who is using her powers to gain powerful weapons from different dimensions. [Slide 5]: Ken Levine, the head developer of the game, uses alternate history partly to experiment with different social histories. Columbia, a utopian community where the game occurs, splits off from the United States at the beginning of the 20th century. You can see how depictions of race are implicated in the experiment. These kinds of posters can be found throughout the game and caused controversy when it was first released. [Slide 6]:Â Part of this controversy came from the depiction of racism in Hollywoodesque terms. The pernicious effects of institutionalized racism, like massive disparities in income, are reduced in Bioshock InfiniteÂ to caricatured acts of individual violence and visual stereotypes. The blogÂ How Many Princesses depicted it this way: âBlack people [in Bioshock Infinite] are shipped up to Columbia as workers, who are essentially slaves and second-class citizens to their wealthier, white counterparts. In case the parallels to the history of American racism arenât obvious enough, Irrational is kind enough to include race-segregated bathrooms in the game.â I mean, I KNOW I’m not racist because I didn’t throw the baseball at the interracial couple at the beginning of the game! Yay! [Slide 7]:Â Â Despite these failures to adequately address the issues of race,Â Bioshock Infinite‘s investigation of alternate history is still interesting and important to understand. Not only are there alternate histories, but the game creates a looping, iterative narrative structure that superimposes various alternate histories on top of one another. This is one fan’s attempt to understand the narrative. I’ve played through the game twice and I still have difficulties. [Slide 8]:Â The game’s looping structure parallels the gaming environment itself, which programmatically is based upon looping conditional statements — as does all computing. Here’s a very simple diagram of the choices and paths one takes on a game start menu. For me, the narratological shape of Bioshock InfiniteÂ is an example of what Alexander Galloway has called identified as protocol, in which the function of cultural power is articulated through computational and technological processes. The looping interface of the game environment creates a series of alternatives that the gamer (partly) manipulates with their controller. [Slide 9]:Â Rob Jackson has shown, for instance, how BioshockÂ gives players the sense that they control much more than they actually do. Jackson explains how the earlierÂ BioshockÂ games depended upon the simulation of “fake” space by graphical trickery, but this practice was replaced inÂ Infinite with the Unreal 3 engine. The dynamic nature of Unreal 3, coupled with the dizzying open spaces found on Columbia constructs a complicated circuit between decision and procedural repetition that mimicks the sense of choice given to a player running through a gaming environment. [Slide 10]:Â Of course, this dynamic is part and parcel ofÂ Infinite‘s narrative, in which all decisions are eventually rendered moot. Towards the end of the game, it’s revealed that your character DeWitt is actually Zachery Comstock from a different dimension — and that DeWitts from innumerable alternate dimensions have been playing different roles in the repeating drama surrounding Elizabeth over and over again, producing one alternate dimension after another. DeWitt tries, and fails, to rescue Elizabeth over 121 times. The game only ends when Elizabeth strangles you (and, if you take into account the DLCs, not even then!). History is literally composed of the accumulated corpses of one failure after another. [Slide 11]: Bioshock Infinite’sÂ complex ending reinscribes, for me, the ideological place of progress within retrofuturist narratives as well as the impact of computation on those fantasies. Frederic Jameson’s 1982 article on utopian progress is interesting givenÂ Bioshock Infinite‘s failure to create an alternative to the Hollywood model of racism. To what degree are steampunk’s ambitions toward the experimental possibilities of alternate history undermined by the real historical infrastructures (economic, ideological, material, technological) of racism? [Slide 12]:Â Yet, I also can’t help but see the parallels between Jameson’s critique of automation and the fact that his article was written two years before the famous 1984 commercial by Apple that introduced Macintosh. As Lori Emerson so eloquently puts it in her bookÂ Reading Writing Interfaces, often what we consider to be technological progress is something that gets handed to us by companies like Apple. If it does anything,Â Bioshock Infinite shows us that the utopian aspirations of those who espouse progressive history often have to contend with multiplying potentialities embedded in networked and recursive systems. [Slide 13]:Â A more fascinating sense of “progress,” for me, is media archaeological: that is the material rise of geological crust constructed by the fossils of dead organisms — and their contribution to what Jussi Parikka has called the “geology of media.” For Parikka, media study should consider the geological materiality of digital media devices. I argue that the digital humanities should encompass these forms of materiality as well.Â Bioshock Infinite, for all of its failures, becomes an example of how the failure of the future is put to use in geological time and emerges on a non-human register. As Jeffrey Cohen argues in his forthcoming bookÂ Stone: An Ecology of the Inhuman, lithic materiality reminds us that the world is not for us. Thanks!
