I'm going to keep this fairly brief, because I've been trying to write this post for two weeks: Starting shortly after THATCamp, I'll be leaving the Center for History and New Media to be the Humanities Design Architect atÂ Scholars' Lab.  The mix of emotions I've had making this decision was almost overwhelming.Â I've been at CHNM since the Fall of 2003, and since that time have done more things as a graduate student than I could have ever imagined. George Mason University was the only school I applied to, and I was ridiculously lucky enough to not only get in, but also get an assistantship at CHNM. Once I got here, each year was better than the next last! I honestly didn't quite know or appreciate how much attending Mason and working at CHNM has changed my life until I decided to leave for someplace else.Â I'm incredibly sad to leave CHNM, the place where I practically learned everything I know about digital humanities. But, oneÂ great thing about this move is that I'll get to keep doing the work I love, with people I'm fortunate enough to call friends and colleagues. I'll still contribute to Omeka, thanks to the partnership CHNM and Â Scholars' Lab already have thanks to a Library of Congress initiative. And, I'll still try to help out with THATCamp as much as possible.  But, if there is one other place in the world I'd like to work other than CHNM, it would be Scholars' Lab. I've been a fanboy of theirs for a while now, and have had some great opportunities to collaborate with them over the past few years. Their approaches to research, teaching, and service are exactly in tune with how I want to spend my career. Plus, being a country boy at heart, the lure of the Shenandoah is too strong to resist.Â I am very excited and honored to join Scholars' Lab, and am looking forward to all the challenges and opportunities this move will bring!
