Xiaojun Wan /  (Submitted on 4 May 2014)h-index has become the most popular indicator for quantifying a scientist's scientific impact in various scientific fields. h-index is defined as the largest number of papers with citation number larger than or equal to h and it treats each citation equally. However, different citations usually come from different papers with different influence and quality, and a citation from a highly influential paper is a greater recognition of the target paper than a citation from an ordinary paper. Based on this assumption, we proposed a new indicator named x-index to quantify a scientist's scientific impact by considering only the citations coming from influential papers. x-index is defined as the largest number of papers with influential citation number larger than or equal to x, where each influential citation comes from a paper for which the average ACNPP (Average Citation Number Per Paper) of its authors larger than or equal to x . Through analysis on the APS dataset, we find that the proposed x-index has much better ability to discriminate between Physics Prize Winners and ordinary physicists.Subjects: Digital Libraries (cs.DL); Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)Cite as: arXiv:1405.0641 [cs.DL] (or arXiv:1405.0641v1 [cs.DL] for this version)Source and Full Text Links Available At:[http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1405/1405.0641.pdf]Thanks to my Facebook colleague, Xavier Ajengo, Director de Proyectos at FundaciÃ³n Ignacio Larramendi, Madrid, Spain
