 We are excited to announce that the Open Library metadata, pointing to the growing collection of content housed by Internet Archive, has been selected for inclusion in the core archive of Outernet. If you are not familiar with Outernet, they’re calling themselves Humanity’s Public Library and they want to increase access to information for people around the world. Read more here (they’ve got a funding thing happening as well). In their own words Currently, 2/3 of humanity lacks Internet access. Outernet wants to broadcast humanity’s best work to the entire world from space. For free. They believe that no one should be denied a basic level of information due to wealth, geography, political environment, or infrastructure. Furthermore, every person should be able to participate in the global marketplace of ideas. They are currently live on four continents with more to come. Users can build their own receiver or purchase one. Inclusion of Open Library metadata will help Outernet users understand the breadth of content that is available. We’re happy to help get more information to more people.
