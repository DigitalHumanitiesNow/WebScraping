 Is Samuel Beckettâs Waiting for Godot funny? Yes. ItâsÂ a comedy about lifeâsÂ tragedies, great and small. Are cartoons inspired by Waiting for Godot funny? â¦mostly not. Especially whenÂ theyâre set in waiting rooms (or airport arrivals areas). GodotâsÂ a hard tropeÂ for aÂ cartoonist on the prowl forÂ something fresh. Dogs, psychiatrists, castaways on desert islands are more elastic subjects, universal, but capable of being spun any number of ways. To wring a comic worthy ofÂ TheÂ New YorkerÂ out of Godot, you probably have to be an actualÂ New Yorker cartoonist, likeÂ Roz Chast, whose instantly recognizable work can be seenÂ above. Other New Yorker cartoonists whoâve taken a crack includeÂ Danny Shanahan,Â Jack ZieglerÂ and Benjamin Schwartz. Not to implyÂ thatÂ New Yorker cartoonists areÂ the onlyÂ source for inspired Godot-inspired comicsâ the late, great HergÃ©, creator ofÂ Tintin made one.  (Oh wait, thatâs notÂ HergÃ©, itâsÂ Tom GauldÂ who illustratesÂ the Guardianâs Saturday Review letters page, scoring major pointsÂ by relocating the terminally upbeat boy detective soÂ outside his comfort zone thatÂ even Snowy is a negative image.)  Cartoonist Richard ThompsonÂ summonedÂ Godot for a strip within a strip installment ofÂ his popular syndicatedÂ Cul de Sac. (Click the image above to view it in a larger format.) Will readers get the reference?Â Alice, his preschool-aged heroine, seems to, astutelyÂ echoing criticÂ Vivian Mercierâs assessment of Godot as a play where ânothing happensâ¦twiceâ.  I reserve my highest praise for the inspired casting ofÂ Beavis and ButtheadÂ inÂ R. Sikoryakâs âWaiting to Go.â Â (.)Â Here we find a Vladimir and Estragon who truly embodyÂ the final lines of Norman Mailerâs notoriousÂ âA Public Notice on Waiting for Godotâ: Manâs nature, manâs dignity, is that he acts, lives, loves, and finally destroys himself seeking to penetrate the mystery of existence, and unless we partake in some way, as some part of this human explorationâ¦ then we are no more than the pimps of society and the betrayers of our Self.
