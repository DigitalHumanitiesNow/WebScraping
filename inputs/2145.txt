Does anyone have experience setting up the collation software CollateX (collatex.net) as a restful service? I am a total novice, with little support right now and would like to set it up as a restful service running in Apache Tomcat. (I am familiar with Eclipse and the basics of mounting a java application in Apache Tomcat,and I can work at the command line.) Could someone point out basic guidance or a setup or war that can be cloned? Many thanks, HL
