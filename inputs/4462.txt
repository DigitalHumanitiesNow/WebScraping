Rahel Aima on Gulf Futurism: Gulf futurism, as I understand it, is conceptualised in the mould of Marinettiâs Italian futurism, and inherits many of the same touchstones. All of its seductiveness: sun, sand, and solar-sintered glassy desolation of the Arabian gulf at the extreme promontory of the millennia. All the beautiful/callous brutality, all the proto-fascism of a society that privileges success and speed over human life. … At base, Gulf futurism is âplus Ã§a change futurism,â all wrapped up in what a friend has dubbed âflying force fields of neo-Arabness.â Itâs not imagining a future so much as mapping shards of future detritusâimagery strongly defined-as-future by Western culture, as you put itâin the present. Itâs an aesthetic scaffolding that reproduces all the injustices, structural degradation and racial erasures of the present.
