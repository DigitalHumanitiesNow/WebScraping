Well, I guess the title says it all. Leaf++ is the brain child of Italian artist Salvatore IaconesiÂ that couples together visual search and social networks to augment (you guessed it) leaves. A user can leave (no pun intended) a message on a leaf, to be seen later by other users scanning the same leaf type.  Watching the above video, it seems that some people get high on leaves.More details can be found on Iaconesi's site.
