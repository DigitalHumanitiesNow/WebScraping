 Awhile back we got an unusual request for temporary access to The Dolley Madison Digital Edition. This is one of the databases in our American Founding Era collection, published by our electronic imprint, Rotunda. Usually such requests come from large research libraries wanting to trial a resource before acquiring it. In this case, however, the users would be three sixth-grade students in Fayetteville, Arkansas. We set them up, went back to the usual business of running a scholarly press, and, to be honest, forgot about it. Last week we received an email that the studentsâMahtaab Sadeghi, Citlalli Gomez, and Zoe Gomoryâhad created a performance piece based on their research of Dolley Madison and had taken their project to the state-level competition for National History Day. They ended up winning first place in the Performance category for the Junior Division, as well as winning the Womenâs History Special Prize. Now the skyâs the limit: the girls will travel to Washington D.C. in June to present their project at the national competition. We wish them the best of luckâandÂ ask that, should any of them grow up to be a famous historian, they give us first dibs on their book.
