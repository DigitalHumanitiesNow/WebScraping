The info-scape around open access has evolved to include a broad range of ideas, skills and research practices. The academic librarianâs role is growing beyond being purely informational, and must include advocacy and participation in changing the system. In this talk, I propose that 1) the crux of scholarly communication is creating peer-partnerships with researchers and scholars, and that in order for the system to evolve, 2) all libraries need a scholarly communication initiative, and 3) all librarians should be invested in this challenging work.
