  I believe that you should truly enjoy the company of the people you work – because you end up spending a majority of your waking time together. Better relationships in the team mean happier people, more creativity, and better work. Building a good team is more important than any particular project and results in better long term quality. The median tenure at Esri seems to be about 7-11 years and not surprising to meet colleagues who have worked together, in the technology industry no less, for 25 or more years. In my nearly two years at Esri our team has shifted and grown – with some going onto new things and others building that close camaraderie over many years together – every one has been a valued colleague that has had their particular touch on the projects and process of our team. When building a team it is imperative to value culture as much as technical acumen. I would rather work with people who are genuinely passionate about making a positive difference and working together than a particular expert. Often itâs nice when you get both at the same time. Over the years Iâve also found it valuable to recruit people from outside the mapping community. They bring fresh insight to a domain that can have a high-learning curve. By having different expectations they can, for at least a short while, portray the user experience of someone new to GIS and build interfaces and technology that fit within the broader scope of information. There are a number of teams in the Esri DC center, and my team has been heads down crafting the first iteration of ArcGIS Open Data as well as a few other projects. This has been through the hard work of just such a dedicated and talented team that are able to effectively work together to ship working products. As we establish our office in DC and the developer community I wanted to take the chance to highlight some of the ‘newerâ engineers, what theyâre working on and what to expect.  Meet the Team today Dave Bouwman and Mike Juniper have brought the depth of experience with GIS from their background that has made a big difference in our support of the unique aspects of projections, services, and version histories. Dave has been particularly prolific on blogging his work with building modern client web applications including telemetry, code coverage and all the things that make products operate smoothly and easy to maintain. Mike, while not canadian like his office-mate Dave, still manages to wrangle some mighty-fine Javascript and you can thank him for everything from Open Data homepage customization to our tabular data views. Jason Wieringa has a long history as a civic developer collaborating with Code for America brigades across the country. Heâs also a fellow Michigander along with Chris Helm (show me on the hand). Jason is one of those few people that can work full-stack, thriving in the Ruby code but just as able to wrangle server infrastructure or do some Angular if he really has to. Brendan Heberton continues to craft compelling interactive visualizations, including highlights in Wired Magazine and The Atlantic. Of course, thatâs when heâs not taking the day off to go storm chasing or do volunteer crisis response mapping. Chris Helm beats the open-source.js drum (also while not getting lost on his bike in the back trails of Colorado) and has been the driving force for the open-source Koop web proxy adapter. Jeremy Schneider does his best to make sure everything we ship works as expected – or at least that the major features do. Heâs our balance of build and deliver fast with better to fix it before anyone notices it. He also dominates our Strava bike team. Matt Madigan has been around the domain of open data longer than any of us – having been one of the original team members behind GeoCommons. In the meantime heâs been an Olympic coach… twice. Perhaps not a coincidence that he now coaches the team that perches 30 meters over the Potomac river looking down upon the sculling teams practicing.  Over the next few weeks youâll be meeting many of our even newer team members. Feel free to reach out to the team @EsriDC or any of us individually – we love to share ideas. And hope to see you at the Esri User Conference in July or at a local GeoDev meetup.
