Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec are collaborating on a clever and beautiful new projectÂ they call Dear DataÂ (Twitter account).Â Every week, they are sending post cards to each other with hand-drawn visualizations of data they have gathered: public transportation, ways they communicate, etc. Giorgia and Stefanie areÂ two of the most interesting people working in data visualization/design/art right now. Both are also incredibly skilled and creative designers, well worth watching.
