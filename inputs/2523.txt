This week the U.S. Supreme Court hears two cases about marriage equality. Today it’s Prop 8; tomorrow it’s DOMA. In case you were wondering, here’s how I feel about the fight to extend marriage benefits to all couples regardless of sexual orientation: I think the LGBT rights movement is far too fixated on this issue, at the expense of some other really important issues that need our attention. I think marriage remains an institution of questionable economic and social value, and one that’s steeped in racism, classism, and religious bias. Even if extended to all individuals regardless of sexual orientation / identity, it would remain a deeply heterosexist institution.But jeezy goddam chreezy, friends–there is just no good reason to limit anyone’s access to marriage, if that’s what they want for their lives. So cut it the crap out, is my position. And as soon as this issue gets resolved, we get to move on to the more pressing issues that need our attention. So the sooner marriage equality is attained, imho, the better for everybody.    Tweet This Post
