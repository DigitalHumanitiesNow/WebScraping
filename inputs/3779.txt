A quick update on the cancer front. Yesterday the neck bandage came off.  The antimicrobial fabric is indeed a medical miracle and apart from the public spectacle part of it, I would recommend it highly.  The open wound area was almost totally gone and the remaining area has responded very well to flamezine.  That’s a relief.  There is still a bunch of black crap on my neck (it looks dirty) and as usual my skin is sore from the adhesive, but I can live. Otherwise, I seem to be recovering well, my head is clearing after being off opiates for awhile, and my energy levels are up, but only because of shameless use of air conditioning.  My voice is still a bit gravelly and doesn’t project well but it is getting better too. If all goes well, cancer updates will be replaced with some nerdy tech updates next week.
