Being listed in the catalogue is an important moment for a Hypotheses blog, as it adds value to active blogs with a structured publishing project. Cataloguing makes blogs more visible and better referenced, in particular because they are attributed an ISSN by the BibliothÃ¨que Nationale de France. It also makes it possible for interested readers to subscribe to the blog and receive regular alerts about its new posts. If your blog has not yet been listed in our catalogue and you think it should be, please contact us at hypotheses[at]openedition.org. On behalf of the Hypotheses team and academic board, we would like to express our deep thanks to bloggers for the vitality of their community, the quality of their publications and their constant inventiveness in developing new practices on their Hypotheses blogs.
