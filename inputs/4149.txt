 Play the game here. The Goblin Market[1] is an experimental game about Charlotte Perkins Gilmanâs short story, The Yellow  Wall-paper. The genre is basically a hybrid of interactive fiction and  text adventure. The Yellow Wall-paper is an extremely famous story and  it has been researched, written about and re-made in other media any  number of times. There is a Suspense! radio broadcast featuring Agnes  Morehead [2] from 1957, a PBS version [3], an animated short [4], three games [5, 6, 7] and a skyrim mod [8] not to mention all of the times it has been reprinted and written about  by scholars. My reason for adding yet another version to this list  was to experiment with ways that games could allow players to interact  with and construct meaning about the past. The game would need to address these fundamental criteria:  Incorporate primary source material, both texts and objects. The player should participate in constructing the narrative. The game should be accessible to as wide an audience as possible so that it could be used for educational purposes.  The game should help players contextualize the issues that helped shape the story: 19th century womenâs issues such as suffrage, marriage, sexuality and birth control.The basic method is this: Start  with a powerful work of fiction that incorporates thematic or emotional  elements that players can explore. In this experiment, The  Goblin Market, I wanted to explore marriage, womenâs rights and  sexuality in the 19th century within the context of The  Yellow  Wall-paper. I think that using fiction from the time helps tap into an  authentic voice from that time period. Analyze and interpret the fiction to identify the themes the game will focus on.Use texts and artifacts from that time period as objects in the game.Allow the artifacts and texts to speak for themselves. Donât explain what they mean to the player. Decide on gameplay and mechanics that support the themes to be expressed.Decide  on the audience. If it is for general education, the game play has to  be accessible and difficult puzzles or challenging game play might get  in the way of reaching a broader audience.note: The Goblin  Market is free for anyone to play and I am very interested in any  feedback and comments as to how we can improve this particular game, or  educational games for higher education and informal learning in general.[spoiler alert- you may want to play the game before reading]History and NarrativeThe  traditional way of understanding and conveying history is in the way of a  narrative that is formed by experts who are part of the peer review  process. This narrative then becomes the âcorrectâ interpretation and often referred to as the voice of authority. This method leads to some confusion between  history and heritage in which history, for the student, becomes a process of memorizing historic facts. There are dates, artifacts and documents that tell  us what happened in the historic record, we know which sides won and lost wars, for example. These facts are unassailable and canât be re-written but the context can change the way you  think about them. History is the raw data of the past and heritage is the  way we use and think about that data in the present. Currently, in  museums and amongst educators and historians, there is a change going on  in how we tell history and the debate centers on this idea of the  single voice of authority. Many now believe that everyone ought  to be involved in interpreting history, not just the experts. The idea  is a little radical and difficult to implement because it means that academics have to let go of that authority. They have to put facts out  there and let people figure things out for themselves, which is a little uncomfortable. You might think  that, since the humanities prides itself on teaching critical thinking,  this would be obvious and everyone would jump on board. Well, it is complicated and  nowhere is this more painfully obvious than in history game design. Two  recent journal articles very clearly illustrate this point. The first  article, âBeyond the âHistoricalâ Simulation: Using Theories of History  to Inform Scholarly Game Design,â [9] states in its abstract:The  gamic mode of history presented in the paper maintains the  constructionist epistemologies and explanatory narratives for the  creation of reasonably justifiable truths found in many current text  based works of scholarly history. It maintains them yet changes the mode  to an interactive digital form where the reader explores the historical  argument through meaningful decision making and play.These  authors state that games exist to help players understand the  narratives that the experts have already decided and agreed on as  âreasonably justified truths.â This is  problematic as critical  thinking is reduced to, on the part of the player, consuming the correct  point of view as determined by those in authority. This approach is  questioned by Antley [10] who wonders if ârather than take a simplistic, reductionist view of the  interplay between history and games, it might suit both the historian  and the student better to uncover the more nuanced and complex  interoperability both spheres of knowledge possess.â Letting  players have agency in making meaning is a perfect fit for game design  but how exactly would it work for a history game? Do players get to  rewrite history? One approach that I have been interested in, involves designing games so  that players function in a way similar to that of the historian.  Historians dig through archives and look at primary documents. From  this, they put together a narrative that explains the historical facts  they have at hand. In the Goblin Market, there are a number of excerpts  from important, primary texts. The idea is that these documents become  part of the narrative, in combination with the fictional story, The  Yellow Wall-paper and the narrative fiction created for the game. When  designing this I imagined that the player would be able to reconstruct  Charlotte Perkins Gilmanâs broader understanding of the narrative using  approaches familiar from games like Dear Esther, Gone Home and The  Thirty-Nine Steps [11].Interpreting the story and its themesThe thing that I find interesting about The Yellow Wall-paper is that it shows  the power that environment and social rules have on the individual; in  this case, the constrictive nature of society drives an otherwise normal  person mad. Much has been made about the ârest cureâ that the  protagonist undergoes in the story. The rest cure was a method,  developed by  S. Wier Mitchell [12, 13],  to cure female patients of hysteria and nervousness disorders by  feeding them rich, fatty foods and making them rest all parts of their  bodies including their brains. Charlotte Perkins Gilman did go through  the rest cure herself and she claimed it exacerbated her illness. She  also claimed, many years after writing the story, that she wrote The  Yellow Wall-paper as propaganda against the rest cure. Was that really  her motivation? Well, we may never be sure of that but Gilman was a prolific writer on womenâs rights and was  not too keen on marriage as an institution. In addition, the story seems  to have been generally received as the horror of a marriage gone wrong [14] and as a tour de force in the illustration of mental breakdown. My  purpose, however, is not to debate Gilmanâs original motivation but to  perhaps re-frame the argument within a broader context to incorporate  ideas that would have been known to her and perhaps had influence. Also, I wanted to bring together primary documents to spark discussion with the classroom.To  me, the application of the rest cure to the nervous female in this story  was done because it expressed patriarchal suppression of the female  spirit and intellect, parallel to that exhibited at a societal level.  Gilman saw marriage and motherhood as oppressive and so The Yellow  Wall-paper paints the picture of the horror of a bad marriage. In this  story we see what can happen when a bored, active mind is not given  intellectual food, it is the horror of intellectual starvation. Marriage  in the 19th century, and before, was an unforgiving process.  Those who chose poorly, male or female, would suffer in all aspects of  their life as so masterfully depicted in George Eliotâs Middlemarch [15].What were the 19th century realities that would have shaped Gilmanâs understanding of marriage? Obviously birth control was a problem for women [16, 17, 18], and having children was not just a financial drain but a great risk. During the 19th and early 20th centuries maternal death due to childbirth was between 4-5% [19](by contrast today it is about 0.01% in developed areas). And, of the women who survived, infanticide was not unknown [20, 21].  Perhaps one of the most difficult aspects of marriage and love was, for  women, their lack of agency in choosing a partner or of gaining the  experience in order to make a sound choice. The notion that a womanâs  value was tied to her sexual lack of experience, or virtue, was  unrealistic and non-human as Gilman herself describes it in An Extinct  Angel [22].  For middle class and wealthy women, marriage was their only career option  and some, like Gilman, could get away with things like âscribblingâ or  art or music. For women who were poor, it was a question of survival.  During the 19th and early 20th century, married  women could not continue to work at their jobs. It was for this reason  also, that women were not promoted as men were understood to be  supporting families.I do not know that Gilman was thinking about these things but they were part of the fabric of 19th century life that are interesting to think about in relation to the story. My objective in designing this game was to bring together  these items, in connection with The Yellow Wall-paper story, so that it  might spark discussion and further exploration in players and the  classroom. I do not want to deliver a single, accepted narrative, but in  the spirit of full disclosure, I must admit that I have certainly  shaped the narrative the players will encounter. The process of  selecting material for the game is one of curation. I chose things to be  presented together and that process in itself will have a great impact  on the material players will have available for narrative construction.Game PlayOne  of the things I wanted to focus on was the idea of powerlessness and  lack of agency or control. I wanted to get this across to the player by  literally locking them into a house from which there is no escape from  an environment which eventually closes down on them. I felt this was a  good fit for a horror game [22, 23].  In The Goblin Market, there are no obvious puzzles or things to do  except figure out the layout of the house. This helps with accessibility  â I want all levels of players to be able to get through the game.  However, it also has a thematic purpose of keeping the players powerless  to give them a sense of the state of 19th century women; they may control little things but, in a larger sense, they are not in control of their world.The  house is a metaphor for Gilmanâs mind and so I wanted to fill it with  things that she could have been thinking about or could have been a part  of her life. As I mentioned earlier, I wanted to express these ideas of  narrative but I also didnât want to project my own understanding of the  topic but I did curate the experience. Most of the things included in  the game are real or factual but they definitely do not tell the whole  story. For example, Charlotte was an activist of sorts - a feminist or  proto-feminist - and her narrative and thoughts are focused, or biased,  as she was concerned with changing peopleâs minds and the world around  her. And so I dutifully included the famous quote from Hillâs manual [25] that is used everywhere to show that women were expected to be âAngels  in the Houseâ and there were manuals to tell them so. However, these  manuals also give instruction to men. It is very clear from these guides  that, although somewhat patronizing and limiting, they generally  understood marriage to be a partnership with each having their sphere of  authority. So, what is the whole story? What are the âreasonably  justified truthsâ? I think most of us all agree that some of the  attitudes towards voting, working, birth control and pre-marital sex are  destructive both to individuals and society. But what was the role of  men and husbands in the 19th century? The fact is that many  men and women worked together to create meaningful and fulfilling lives  within their social restrictions. Indeed, many women even found the rest  cure beneficial and it was popular for some time. But I felt, to  express Gilmanâs story, I had to focus on elements that expressed her  personal point of view. But I also wanted to at least give players a  clue, that history is rarely so black and white. For that reason I also  included part of Hillâs manual that gave instruction to men.The  one thing that I really struggled with for a long time was the game  genre and what it should look like. I settled on a text adventure because that would require the player to participate in meaning making by imagining the setting.  Initially, I  was thinking in terms of the blank screen of a text adventure: just you,  some text and your imagination but I also wanted to bring in some  visual elements of ads and ephemera from the time period. I felt a  framing element would also help limit the space; again, I was always  looking for ways of limiting the player while trying to spur on the  imagination, parallel to the Yellow Wall-paperâs protagonist. I was  looking for artwork from the end of the 19th century and  Aubrey Beardsleyâs work just seemed right. The borders have that feel of a book illustration (well, they were book illustrations). Also,  Beardsley was known  for some very risquÃ© illustrations [26] and I mentally liked the juxtaposition of the excesses of Beardsley with the idea of the moral Angel.I was initially very influenced by games like Candy Box and A Dark Room [26, 27] and had originally designed a game with a number of management  activities that would allow players to step into the shoes of a lower  middle class young girl trying her hand at the marriage market by first  working to help her family and putting herself in the path of a suitable  husband. However, I decided against that because I felt that this story  was emotional and that management activities would take away from the  point which is that your mind has nothing to do and so you start imaging  all kinds of things. I didnât want players focused on getting jobs and  updating their wardrobe. So in the end, I imagined this as a text based  Gone Home [29] meets Dear Esther [30]. In addition, I adapted descriptive passages from older texts to help create a vintage horror feel [30, 31].ConclusionI  am not sure what historians will think of this method of conflating  fiction and historic facts and the next step is to test this in  classrooms and assess how it all works. I am also very interested in  feedback from the game-playing public as to engagement. Was this game  engaging and/or interesting? Did it make you want to learn more about  the subject matter?Works Cited[1]          âGoblin Market by Christina Rossettiâ¯: The Poetry Foundation.â [Online].
