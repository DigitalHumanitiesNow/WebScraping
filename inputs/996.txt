I've been pretty bad lately for The latest history carnival, number 51, is available at A Don's Life. 300 and Foucault are among the many great topics blogged this week by the history blogosphere. I'll be hosting History Carnival 52 on May 1, so send nominations for the the best blogging in the month of April to jeremy AT clioweb DOT org.
