Students are evolving.  The student 2.0 is an altogether different animal than the student 1.0.  And our classrooms are ecosystems, an environment all their own, where we each must decide how to engage this new species of student.  But the walls of our classrooms have been breached.  The front of the classroom lies in ruin, and the teacher standing behind a lectern has become an anachronism.  The entire system has suffered a swift and certain decay.  Now, we teeter at a slowly disintegrating threshold, one foot in a physical world and the other in a virtual one.  I feel some brief nostalgia but scrabble eagerly, hopefully from the rubble.
