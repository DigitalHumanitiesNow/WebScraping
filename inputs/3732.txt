 I stared at that wall for days.  Quickly Carrie and my mom got sick of it, so there’s a poster of a sculpture I like at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, and a poster for a talk by Cornelius Borck, with whom I was co-teaching a class that term.  Judging by the tape marks, we weren’t the first ones to decorate. I confess to having some trouble processing the fact that I was effectively unconscious from the 12th through sometime on the 16th or 17th. Â But now that we’re past all those dates, I mostly feel grateful to be here in California and not in that room.
