A few weeks back, the self-described “independent scholar and business analyst living in Los Angeles,” James Pulizzi, rose to defend Adam Kirsch’s thin polemical takedown of digital humanities on the pages of the New Republic‘s online edition.

We are grateful to the New Republic for its willingness to allow us to respond (twice).
