For a year or two, weâve been using the Yahoo/YBoss/YDN Spelling Service API to provide spell suggestions for queries in our homegrown discovery layer. (Which provides UI to search the catalog via Blacklight/Solr, as well as an article search powered by EBSCOHost api). It workedâ¦ good enough, despite doing a lot of odd and wrong things. But mainly it was cheap. $0.10 per 1000 spell suggest queries, according to this cached price sheet from April 24 2105.Â  However, I got an email today that they are âsimplifyingâ their pricing by charging for all âBOSS Search APIâ services atÂ $1.80 per 1000 queries,Â starting June 1. Thatâs 18x increase. Previously we paid about $170 a year for spell suggestions from Yahoo, peanuts, worth it even if it didnât work perfectly. Thatâs 1.7 million querries for $170, pretty good. Â (Honestly, Iâm not sure if thatâs still making queries it shouldnât be, in response to something other than user input. For instance, we try to suppress spell check queries on paging through an existing result set, but perhaps donât do it fully). But 18x $170 is $3060. Â Thatâs a pretty different value proposition. Anyone know of any decent cheap spell suggest APIâs? It looks like maybe Microsoft Bing has a poorly documented one. Â Not sure. Yeah, we could role our own in-house spell suggestion based on a local dictionary or corpus of some kind. aspell, or Solrâs built-in spell suggest service based on our catalog corpus. Â But we donât only use this for searching the catalog, and even for the catalog I previously found these APIâs based on web searches provided better results than a local-corpus-based solution. Â The local solutions seemedÂ to false positive (provide a suggestion when the original query was ârightâ) and false negative (refrain from providing a suggestion when it was needed) more often than the web-based APIâs. As well, of course, as being more work on us to set up and maintain.Filed under: General
