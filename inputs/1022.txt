It’s that time of year again, July in San Diego with a whole lot of other people, all talking about GIS. Â Plus Ã§a change, plus c’est la mÃªme chose.Â  This year I’ll beÂ in two sessions, the first on our ROGTAL project, Research on Geospatial Technologies and Learning, a group effort in which I’m honored to be a member. Â You’ll hear about our proposed research agenda and recommendations for this field. Â Saturday afternoon, in the 3:15-4:30pm session titled Meeting Education Mandates, La Costa Room. Then on Sunday morning (early!, before the Plenary! Â Set your alarms and bring your coffee!) I’ll be leading a session on Cultivating Spatial Thinking & Problem Solving with SpatiaLABS. Â 8:30am, Leucadia Room. Â Don’t know about Esri’s SpatiaLABS yet? Â  This is your chance to get all the insider information on this FREE resource, get a sneak preview at a new search-and-sort website, get your questions answered by the series editor, and find out how you too could become a (paid) contributor! Â Don’t snooze, come schmooze instead.
