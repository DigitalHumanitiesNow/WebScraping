We have now reached the 1000-volume landmark for  British History Online. Each of these has been approved by our advisory panel of academics as being a valuable work of history and has been digitised according to the gold standard of text capture: double rekeying by specialist companies. The Institute of Historical Research launched BHO in 2003 and we are now serving over a million page views per month. As users of BHO will know, our core strengths are in two areas: Early Modern works, including the Calendars of State Papers, and local history, including the Victoria County History. The bulk of BHO is free for anyone to use, with a section being reserved for the subscriptions which sustain the site. This is an auspicious moment to have reached our thousandth volume, as BHO becomes part of IHR Digital, the new publishing and consultancy arm of the Institute.
