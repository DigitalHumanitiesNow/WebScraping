I participated in a webinar hosted by the Prospect Research Institute. Â We discussed the ways that NodeXL can simplify the task of collecting social media and social network data. Â The tool generates easy to understand reports that highlight insights into connected structures.  The slides associated with the talk can be found here:    2014 TheNextWeb-Mapping connections with NodeXL  from Marc Smith Analyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL: Insights from a Connected World
