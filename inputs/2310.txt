This page contains resources for historians who have started thinking about evidence as data but are still figuring out the ins and outs of data clean-up and storage. The live workshop, for historians attending the AHAâs Getting Started in Digital History workshop on Jan. 2, 2015, will use OpenRefine to look at some of the steps involved in data normalization (breaking evidence into fields, handling typos and other data abnormalities) and then examine some of the solutions for scholars moving from proprietary software (Word, Excel) to data formats that make sharing and maintaining data easier. First, go read A Good Scholarly Article: http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/2-3/big-smart-clean-messy-data-in-the-humanities/ OR TWO! Edited Jan 19 to add: this article by Thomas Padilla is also an excellent look at evidence and data in humanities research Then, think about cleaning up your data. If you’re not in the workshop, tackle OpenRefine on your own: A basic tutorial: http://schoolofdata.org/handbook/recipes/cleaning-data-with-refine/ Using facets and clusters to clean data: http://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/using-google-refine-for-data-cleaning David Huynhâs tutorial: http://davidhuynh.net/spaces/nicar2011/tutorial.pdf, which uses the data here:Â http://electionstatistics.sos.la.gov/Data/Elected_Officials/ElectedOfficials.xls Some beginner OpenRefine cheat sheets can be really handy as you start working with your data: Cheat sheet: http://arcadiafalcone.net/GoogleRefineCheatSheets.pdf Basic OpenRefine recipes:https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Recipes A list of external resources: https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/External-Resources Sample data sets: https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Sample-Datasets Cleaning up dates: http://icantiemyownshoes.wordpress.com/2014/04/24/clean-up-dates-and-openrefine/ There are also advanced or specialized OpenRefine recipes that can help you take the next step: Exporting OpenRefine to sample geoJSON template: http://schoolofdata.org/2014/05/19/putting-points-on-maps-using-geojson-created-by-open-refine/ A sample process with SQL and OpenRefine: http://icantiemyownshoes.wordpress.com/2014/04/15/openrefine-and-messy-legacy-access-points-in-an-archivists-toolkit-database/ Example of reconciling OpenRefine data with external taxonomies (names, etc.): http://iphylo.blogspot.com/2012/02/using-google-refine-and-taxonomic.html (OpenRefine has an active call out to get their OpenRefine reconciliation working with historical newspaper database APIs) Cleaning up bibliographies: http://acrl.ala.org/techconnect/?p=3276 Scraping PDFs and cleaning them up in OpenRefine: http://noelmas.github.io/blog/ddj-tips/scraping/2014/12/21/scraperwiki-pdf-extract-openrefine/ And, for good measure, a fun OpenRefine link with bonus Eddie Izzard reference: http://practicaldatamanagement.wordpress.com/2014/05/16/help-me-im-covered-in-bees-or-using-openrefine-to-clean-specimen-data/ Once your data is clean, think about how you will store and retrieve it, and how other historians will find it. In the long term. We’re only tackling the very basics of text markup and metadata but historians also need to consider the storage of images and other file formats for long term management and retrieval.
