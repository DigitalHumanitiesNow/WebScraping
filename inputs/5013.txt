The blog showcases innovative ideas and projects happening in the library technology world, so there is a lot of room for contributor creativity. Possible post formats could include interviews, how-tos, hacks, and beyond. Any LITA member is welcome to apply. Library students and members of underrepresented groups are particularly encouraged to apply. Contributors will be expected to write one post per month. Writers will also participate in peer editing and conversation with other writers â nothing too serious, just be ready to share your ideas and give feedback on othersâ ideas. Writers should expect a time commitment of 1-3 hours per month. Not ready to become a regular writer but youâd like to contribute at some point? Just indicate in your message to me that youâd like to be considered as a guest contributor instead. To apply, send an email to briannahmarshall at gmail dot com by Friday, May 29. Please include the following information: A brief bio Your professional interests, includingÂ 2-3 example topics you would be interested in writing about If possible, links to writing samples, professional or personal, to get a feel for your writing style Send any and all questions my way!
