Fancy learning to be a data-viz ninja? Iâm planning my first ever public data-visualisation workshops. I’ve published two books, created 567 graphics and made 1923 mistakes. The data suggests to me that Iâm ready to share my method and process. Maybe you’d like to join me? What’s it entail? This new workshop format has been developed over a few years of private events. It’s a mix of lecture & hands-on exercises with plenty of discussion and sharing. It’s honed to a tight, fun and creative transmission of the method I use to create data and information visualisations. It covers: Â» concepting and the generation of good, interesting ideas Â» researching and curating juicy data Â» executing and selecting appropriate & effective visualisations Â» designing and beautifying impactful charts & diagrams Itâs a fun intro to the infographics approach: lots of pens, paper, sketching, sharing etc. All with a solid underpinning of theory. Everyone leaves with their own dataviz and nice handout materials. Where and when Here are the first dates. Click for ticketing and ordering info. Â» New York (Manhattan), April 21stÂ - sold out.

We also might develop a webinar / teleconference type format. So let us know if that style of learning appeals to you. Private workshops?
