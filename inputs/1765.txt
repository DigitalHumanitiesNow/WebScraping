Oral History in the digital Age is launched. The OHDA project represents a partnership between MATRIX, theÂ Michigan State University Museum, the Smithsonian InstitutionÂ Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage, the Library of CongressâÂ American Folklife Center, theÂ American Folklore Society, and theÂ Oral History Association. Seven interdisciplinary working groups composed of experts and practitioners from museums, libraries, and scholarly societies worked to produce recommendations around core topics including intellectual property, transcriptions, digital video, technology, scholarship, preservation, and access. Final recommendations from all groups were compiled and published on the OHDA website as a guide to conducting digital oral history.
