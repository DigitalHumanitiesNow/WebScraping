Evolution of the Skyscraper, a diagram comparing skyscrapers since 1908.  The Civil Defense Museum has a page on fallout shelter signs.  Making Sense of Marcel Duchamp. Not sure if that's possible, but this site helps a little.  New York Changing is a website that juxtaposts photos of New York from the 1930s with photos from today. Interesting to see what has changed and what hasn't.
