This same Gates program funded the development of 19 apps/services/websites to more efficiently help students navigate the college application and transition process (as well as succeed in college when they are there). We need your help We are looking for a middle school that would be interested in collaborating on one of our projects. We will be testing a game app to see how well it helps middle schoolers learn about the college-going process. Students would use the app for about 6 weeks and weâd evaluate their college-going knowledge before and after the app intervention. This is a great way to supplement existing middle school programs, plus youâd be helping us learn more about what works with educational apps. If you are an administrator at a middle school and are interested, please email me directly by clicking here. If you know of someone who might be interested, please forward this along to her or him.
