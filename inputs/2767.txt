Here is a selection of notable links from the design and web development front. For those working with type on the web, I highly recommend the following 24 Ways article written by Richard Rutter: âCompose to a Vertical Rhythm.â I also recommend Meagan Fisherâs 24 Ways articleâMake Your Mockup in Markup.â Are you exploring progressive enhancement in your designs via CSS3? Then CSS3 Please! The CrossâBrowser CSS3 Rule Generator is just your ticket. For some POSH (Plain Old Semantic HyperText) design, I think the following articles on markup and semantic class names are quite useful: âThe Elements of Meaningful XHTML,â âCompetent Classing,â âKeep Your Classes Clean,â and âA Touch of Class.â Of course, I would be remiss if I did not provide a few notable links from the digital history front. To that end, I suggest George Lakoffâs articles on âGulf War Metaphor, Part Iâ and âPart IIâ as well as Cameron Chapmanâs âApplying  âA Pattern Languageâ To Online Community Designâ as worthy reading. Both Lakoffâs and Chapmanâs articles made me wonder about the of role languageâboth used and constructedâin digital history? I think this is a particularly intriguing question when one considers how digital historians use one languageâe. g. POSHâto construct digital history tools and another languageâe. g. Englishâto develop and promulgate (the language of?) community and collaboration via digital history tools. Finally, on a ânonâ digital history front but engaging nonetheless is Paddy Donnellyâs  âLearn  To Fucking Spell.â His post is engaging not only for its subject matter but also how that subject matter is effectively communicated through the lush illustrationsâanother language in its own rightâthat heavily inform the post.
