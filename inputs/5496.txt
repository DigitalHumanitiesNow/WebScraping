Dear tater tots,It is with utmost joy, enlightened rapture, and a bar of celebratory Belgian chocolate in my hand that I write this post today. For the past ten days, and the following eleven weeks I have banished myself to a quaint little Dutch canal town called Leiden to get a taste of âinternational mobilityâ and âinternationalizationâ, of which the academic world is so very fond. Now, I donât mind peeking over hedges and borders once in a while, as long as the curtains remain drawn in crucial places. This way, I found out that my ivy was growing into my next-door neighborâs bathroom, who had left for prison a couple of years before and forgot to close the window on his way out. Not knowing what he was charged for, I rather didnât take any risks and removed all traces of this floral intrusion immediately. On another occasion, while coming home from work on a not so particularly hot and humid day, I happened to look into a living room a couple of doors away, to find its owner spread out on the couch in front of the window, with nothing wrapped around his chunky frame but a mucky pair of undies, a grimy tank top even Onslow would shy away from, one hand clasped around a XL can of beer, the other lazily scratching his balls, giving me a disgusting grin when he noticed my intrusive glance. Would it kill to get a pair of G-Stars for once?!Anywho, I must admit I was a bit reluctant to come here. You see, Iâm a bit picky when it comes to certain culinary standards, in particular relating to cacao-infused products. So you can imagine my euphoria when I discovered true Belgian chocolate when buying groceries the other day. But this post is not about the indescribable feeling of heavenly bliss one experiences when discovering oneâs favorite treat in the snack section. No, the joy, enlightenment, rapture and bar of celebratory Belgian chocolate referred to in my first sentence are all related to a discovery I made just a couple of days ago, a discovery that changed the course of my own measly part of history and will hopefully do the same to yours.For some time now, I have been struggling with the insanely frustrating fact that after having generated a network and writing a flourishing piece of prose about it, either for the blog here, of for a paper of some sorts, all I could do was take lousy static screenshots and smack them between the lines. Which is really impractical, because these networks are often huge and bulky and tangled, and to get a feel for them, you need to be able to play around with them. But they just sit there, like a stereotypical busty blond straddling a motorcycle: itâs sexy, so it sells, but donât try prodding it for more info, because nothing will come out (although some of those blonds probably donât mind being played around with from time to time, Iâm sure).As some of you may have noticed, a call went out on the networks network mailing list last week addressing this spreading-the-network-love issue. I immediately shouted out my exasperation, and got a little nudge from our very first spaghetti-os interviewee, pointing me in the direction of sigma.js, a JavaScript library that helps display networks online. Java-who? Did anyone say coffee? Iâm guessing I already lost most of you munchkins by now, and I didnât fare any better either. I was willing to give it a go, like any new software shizzle they throw at me these days. And even though the website advertises sigma.js as âfrom beginners to advanced usersâ, my gut feeling almost instantly warned me that this was waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay over my head. I know squat about HTML, CSS, MySQL, PHP, XML, whatever abbreviation rocks your nation (for all I know, they all stand for the same); heck, I couldnât even get the required files installed (note to all you brainy code lovers out there: network enthusiast â  computer scientist; some of us need tutorials for dummies!). I started drowning in despair again.But God created spaghetti monsters for a reason, and along with that reason he created the Oxford Internet Institute. In the Gephi plugin marketplace, surrounded by a halo of holy networky light, you can spot their most life-altering creation: the sigma.js export plugin. What does this wonderful little marvel do? With a simple tap of a button, it transforms the network you produced in Gephi, in all its vibrant colors and tangles, into series of files and folders that you save to your computer in a location of your very own choosing in a folder called ânetworkâ (so imaginative!), after which you can upload this folder to your webserver and ta-da! Bye bye skimpy blond, hello bright and brainy brunette: you can now play around all you want. You can zoom in and out to scan the network. When passing over a node, its ego network is highlighted; click on it, and you get an overview of its attributes, centrality measures, component ID, and connections. You can add a legend to indicate what the nodes and edges stand for, a short and a detailed description, even your own logo if you have one! No kidding, Iâm in â¤â¤â¤luuurveâ¤â¤â¤!Let me show you what all the fuss is about. Remember the Harry Potter network from the post about modularity classes? This is the screenshot I posted back then: Ok, so this is not the most unreadable network out there, agreed. But still, itâs boring. It just sits there. Now go check out the same network, exported from Gephi with the help of our new best friends at OII. I rest my case. All Iâve got left to say for now is: OII peeps, gracias. Muchas muchas muchas.    Yanne
