On Friday, January 23, Wentworth Professors (and Curley Project Managers) Gleason and Gordon visited MIT for a day-long workshop focused on “Collaborative Insights through Digital Annotation” and led a Breakout Session on “Digital Public Humanities.”Â  Much of the day focused on best practices for Annotation Studio, an online application developed by MIT’s Hyperstudio.Â Â  Annotation Studio is one of the tools currently being used as part of the Curley virtual house museum project.
