 @academicdave Wow. Hadn't seen the nation's weather for a while. 12" in Dallas is much more #snowpacalypse than DC's 50 inches. in reply to academicdave # @mkirschenbaum I know. Southerners are silly. And this is about 5x as much snow as all my previous 8 years combined. in reply to mkirschenbaum # @kelseyagnew I hope there's blue and raspberry flavors. in reply to kelseyagnew # Apparently there's 4-5 inches of snow on ground in ATL. Just like the flooding in Sept, we're out of town (at my folks) for extreme weather. # So THAT was fast. Just got a request for reference letters for the job I applied to at midnight. #jobmarket #fingerscrossed # Application is out the door.

Do I get a prize for being (obnoxiously) bleeding edge? # RT @dancohen: Brown University launches Center for Digital Scholarship: http://j.mp/ctvyea # @mlaconvention No, I hadn't. I *am*, however, a master of the Renaissance of the Postmodern Asian. Too bad that's not what they want. in reply to mlaconvention # Glad to see poetry beginning to creep into #eng399 and #e399 students' tweets. # @clioweb It wasn't one of these, was it? http://bit.ly/drsz0b in reply to clioweb # Oh, and that impossible #jobmarket ad? They also want you to teach play-writing! Here's the ad: http://bit.ly/cPPoZo. # @loriemerson Would love to be there, but I'll be commuting. Good luck with it all! in reply to loriemerson # "Preference given to candidates with expertise in Asian literatures, Postmodern theory, and Renaissance literature." #jobmarket #impossible # @TCMcClernon And miles to go before you sleep, no doubt. in reply to TCMcClernon # @samplereality I'm not seeing anything here about source code. What am I missing? in reply to samplereality # Just wrote @eastgate the longest email ever. Condolences, Mark. # I just let a class go early by 10 minutes. There mist be something wrong with me. # Have just installed Victory Garden on office computer, & I'm now sure that it's been behaving strangely on both my Macs.

The former more than the latter, I think. in reply to samplereality # @wpwend42 I'm going to do a fresh install on office computer tomorrow and see if I can replicate. in reply to wpwend42 # @HunterStofan But poetry isn't my thing either. I'm out to teach you skillz though. (Believe it or not.) in reply to HunterStofan # @HunterStofan In my 310 course, I make students write a paper on a single word in a poem. Beware! in reply to HunterStofan # Victory Garden is being SO weird. Am hitting loops much sooner than I ever have before. # @eastgate Should be more clear. Now that I can compare the two side by side, it appears that OS doesn't affect the text. Map still prob tho. in reply to eastgate # @eastgate Not seeing differences myself. Am having problem clicking on any portion of the map of garden though, in either OS 10.5 or 10.6. in reply to eastgate # @digitalcampus So…I look forward to hearing your take on #buzz. # How to kill #buzz (via @foundhistory): set "hide" under settings -> labels, unfollow everyone, and check "turn off buzz" at bottom of gmail. # @ryancordell HOOOOOOO-RAAAAAAH!!!  Congratulations! They are lucky to have you! #jobmarket in reply to ryancordell # @foundhistory Do you mean to say that you're a #buzz kill? in reply to foundhistory # @foundhistory I just got it on my account and am checking it out. @nowviskie has made me (rightly) gun shy. in reply to foundhistory # @HunterStofan So what you're saying is that you'd like the *next* paper assignment to be on Whitman? #eng399 in reply to HunterStofan # @jaheppler I think the point is that it's based on those you email most.And your email habits didn't take introduction of #buzz into account in reply to jaheppler # I'm also thinking that Storyspace is working differently on Snow Leopard than on Leopard. Can you confirm this @eastgate? # This is a strange time through Victory Garden. Haven't seen some of these lexias before. # Whoa.
