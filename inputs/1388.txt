I found some good Photoshop tutorials for creating "aged" or "worn" looks. See below:  Basic Background. Marble Backgrounds. Using the basic background tutorial, this page shows you how to make a cracked marble background. Old-Style Cloud Effects -- My favorite among these. The finish project is really cool. That Wiked Worn Look: The Series -- Great set of tutorials from Cameron Moll. I'm planning to use a few of these techniques as I'm designing my CSS Zen Garden submission that I'm modeling on a WPA poster. I'm tentatively calling it "Tilling the Soil".
