  //www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSNj4clHP08   	   You may remember that when we featured the favorite films of Federico Fellini, theÂ 8 1/2Â directorâs top-ten list includedâ¦Â well, 8 1/2. But then, no filmmaker before Fellini or after him has had quite the same sensibility, so if Fellini made the kind of movies he himself wanted to watch â and IÂ suspect he made onlyÂ that kind of movie â then we might wonder why his list didnât include even more of his own work. And maybe we should wonder the same about this list of favorites fromÂ Luis BuÃ±uel, the Spanish surrealist who started doingÂ for vivid, dreamlike, and grotesque European cinema in the 1920s what Fellini kept doing for it until the 1990s: Underworld (1927, Josef von Sternberg) The Gold Rush (1925, Charles Chaplin) The Bicycle Thief (1947, Vittorio De Sica) Battleship Potemkin (1925, Sergei Eisenstein) Portrait of Jennie (1948, William Dieterle) Cavalcade (1933, Frank Lloyd) White Shadows in the South Seas (1928, W.S. Van Dyle/Robert Flaherty) Dead of Night (1945, Alberto Cavalcanti/Charles Crichton/Basil Deardon/Robert Hamer) LâAge dâOr (1930, Luis Bunuel/Salvador Dali) I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932, Mervyn LeRoy)  At the top of the post, you can watchÂ BuÃ±uelâs number-one pick,Â Josef von Sternbergâs silent proto-gangster picture Underworld. Just above, youâll find his number-nine pick, and the one he had a hand in himself:Â LâAge dâOr, the 1930 societalÂ satireÂ on which he collaborated with the Spanish artistÂ Salvador DalÃ­. It came as the follow-up to their 1929 silent shortÂ Un Chien Andalou, a work widely recognized as the foundation stone of surrealist cinema (see alsoÂ our post on both films), and it came with much greater ambitions. NeitherÂ BuÃ±uelâs own directorial styleÂ norÂ the medium of cinema itself had quite found their form yet; those conditions produced a film that still retains many striking and even cutting qualities today, albeit not, perhaps, to the same degree that they causedÂ contemporary right-wingers toÂ toss ink at the screen and start brawls in the aisles. WatchÂ the pre-1930 films on the list, like Battleship Potemkin andÂ The Gold Rush, to understandÂ what formed BuÃ±uelâs cinematic sensibility; watchÂ LâAge dâOr to understand why, when it comes to his own work, he prefers the early stuff. via Combustible Celluloid Related Content: Two Vintage Films by Salvador DalÃ­ and Luis BuÃ±uel: Un Chien Andalou and LâAge dâOr Read Filmmaker Luis BuÃ±uelâs Recipe for the Perfect Dry Martini, and Then See Him Make One Federico Felliniâs List of His 10 Favorite Films â¦ Includes One of His Own Colin Marshall writes onÂ cities, language, Asia, and menâs style.Â Heâs at work on a book about Los Angeles,Â A Los Angeles Primer,Â andÂ the video seriesÂ The City in Cinema.Â Follow him on Twitter atÂ @colinmarshallÂ or onÂ Facebook.
