A new digital research center has been launched at Calvin Theological Seminary, and it will serve as the new permanent home of the Post-Reformation Digital Library. The Junius Institute for Digital Reformation Research is a forum for the promotion of research into the Reformation and post-Reformation eras, particularly through the use and development of digital tools and sources.  For more about the Junius Institute and its development out of the efforts behind the Post-Reformation Digital Library, read the press release. If you have benefited from the PRDL, you can now support its work through the Junius Institute and help us to assure the ongoing stability and improvement of the project.
