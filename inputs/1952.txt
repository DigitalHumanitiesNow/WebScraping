 Herewith, the second quick update post. A New Cluster at #Alt-Academy A few weeks ago, on 27 January 2014, I was pleased to join Katina RogersÂ in announcing a new phase of #Alt-Academy. The open-access collection edited by Bethany Nowviskie first went live in the summer of 2011 and included essays that sought to define âalt-acâ as a concept of labor, employment, and identity within the realm of higher education.Â I contributed an essayÂ to that original collection that discussed how one went about finding and applying for alt-ac positions, as well as discussing how I personally coped with the âfailureâ of not being on the tenure track. Myself notwithstanding,Â #Alt-AcademyÂ is an important collection because it was a first attempt to make visible a type of work that many of us found rewarding and as intellectually stimulating as the tenure track.Â The success of the intervention was such that âalt-acâ continues to be a handy term of art, as seen by the upcoming CALS Symposium at Penn State on the subjectÂ where Bethany, Patricia Hswe, and I, among others, will have the pleasure of presenting. In 2012, I pitched Bethany on an idea for a new cluster of content to be added to the collection. Iâd found in the intervening years that the thing people inevitably wanted to know about my position was how Iâd got to my job from a very traditional PhD program. Indeed, my essay in #Alt-AcademyÂ along with the others in its cluster was intended to highlight the process of âGetting There.â I proposed to Bethany that people curious about alt-ac might need still more signposts, and she agreed. After announcing a CFP in 2012, I began collecting proposals and then several essays in the beginning of 2013. And somewhere in there is where the reality of an alt-ac job cropped up: it took me far longer to edit the essays than I had thought it would, and while I made some progress it was going to be some time before they were all ready to be published.[1] In the fall of this last year, Katina let me know that she would be taking over general editorship at #Alt-AcademyÂ from Bethany. As Katina and I began collaborating, she proposed that I not try to get all the pieces ready to go at once but instead publish them on a rolling basis, and this is exactly what we launched. The new cluster, âLooking for Signpostsâ features five essays out of the gate by Kim Yates, Andrew Asher, Daveena Tauber, Maureen McCarthy, and Katina herself. I also wrote a new introduction for the cluster. Spoliler:Â in it, I confess that our signposts arenât quiteÂ what youâre looking for in the collection. Since alt-ac paths tend to be highly idiosyncratic, what we end up doing is simply bearing witness to the possibility of alternatives. As uncommon as that still is within the academy, Iâm pleased to say itâs becoming more and more common. Iâm very grateful to the authors who contributed to this clusterâboth those who have been published and those who are yet to come. And Iâm also thankful to Bethany and Katina for the help that theyâve provided me along the way. And since we hope to be releasing new essays about every quarter, I suppose I better get back to work!  [1] It turns out that being in an alt-ac job is also why this post is kind of late. Between teaching my class this semester, all I could manage for the launch in January was tweeting and giving +1s to Katina’s post.
