I've embedded my assignment in my Documentary class blog. Here's the permalink.  It's not much and, like my class post says, the sound is a little distorted in some areas of the film. I'm not sure why this happened. I'm currently working on a revised version of the short doc, one with better sound and transitions from one image to the next. I agree with Paula that there's too much darkness between some images, which breaks up the flow of the film.
