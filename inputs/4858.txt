  //www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8HEwO-2L4w   	   Until the end of his life, Carl SaganÂ (1934-1996) continued doing what he did all along â popularizing science and âenthusiastically conveying the wonders of the universe to millions of people on television and in books.â Whenever SaganÂ appeared on ââThe Tonight ShowâÂ with Johnny Carson during the 70sÂ and 80s, his goal was to connect with everyday Americans â people who didnât subscribe to Scientific AmericanÂ â andÂ increase the publicâs understanding and appreciation of science. At the end of his life, Sagan still cared deeply about where science stood in the public imagination. But while losing a battle withÂ myelodysplasia, Sagan also sensed thatÂ scientific thinking was losing ground in America, and even more ominously within the chambers of the Newt Gringrich-led Congress. During his finalÂ interview, aired on May 27, 1996,Â Sagan issued a strongÂ warning, telling Charlie Rose: Weâve arranged a society on science and technology in which nobody understands anything about science and technology, and this combustible mixture of ignorance and power sooner or later is going to blow up in our faces. I mean, who is running the science and technology in a democracy if the people donât know anything about it. 20 years later, figures like Neil deGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye are out there, trying to popularize science with new forms of media. But the same structuralÂ problem, so well articulated by Sagan, remains largelyÂ in place. And yet thereâs reason to hope. Because even as establishment politicians stillÂ play the same games with science, there are early signs that, as with other important issues, public opinion is shifting beneath their feet.
