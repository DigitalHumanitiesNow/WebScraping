 At BHO we are considering the possibility of republishing some of the transcriptions produced by Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP). Our aim would be to select texts that work particularly well with current BHO content, but we would be delighted to hear the views of BHO users. The list below is not a list of proposed candidates, but simply illustrates the range of texts that ECCO-TCP has to offer: John Arbuthnot: An Enquiry into the Connection Between the Present Price of Provisions and the Size of Farms Madame d’Aulnoy: The History of the Earl of Warwick, Sirnam’d the King-Maker John Brown: A Compendious History of the British Churches in England, Scotland, Ireland and America Daniel Defoe: A Tour Thro’ the Whole Island of Great Britain Charles Dibdin: A Complete History of the English Stage Robert Douglas: The Peerage of Scotland John Hawkins: Observations on the State of the Highway David Hume: The History of England: under the House of Tudor Maiden Hospital: Statutes of Maiden Hospital Joseph Moxon: Mechanick Execises: or the doctrine of handy-works William Oldys: The Life of Sir Walter Ralegh Thomas Paine: Common Sense Thomas Pennant: A Tour of Wales Adam Smith: An Enquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations Horace Walpole: Anecdotes of Painting in England Please do comment if you have an opinion on which kinds of ECCO-TCP texts you’d like to see on BHO. Please note, though, that ECCO-TCP is only a small subset of the much larger ECCO resource.
