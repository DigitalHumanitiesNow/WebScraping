The Open Access e-journal Zeitenblicke 12 (2013), Nr. 1,  is an interesting issue -based on interviews organised by EUI Ph.D.  researchers and also single essays- dealing with the research community  and activities in the History and Civilisation Department at the European University Institute  (EUI). These essays and interviews are showcasing and informing about  the many intellectual challenges that are part of the daily activities  of the EUI History department.Zeitenblicke is part of the excellent Historicum.Net, a portal for the Historical Sciences on the Internet in Germany. Sehepunkte,  a component of the portal, is the best place to look for book reviews  in the field of history in Germany -all historical periods are included  and interdisciplinary works are also reviewed-, and Lesepunkte, a third component of the portal, is a platform for history teachers. Historicum.net  is one of the best online history projects in Germany which is supported  by the State Library of Bayern, the University of Cologne and many other German partners. Chronicon  is a sophisticated search engine which allows better knowledge of the portalâs complete contents. The only criticism that could be raised -but  this is an important one- is that nothing, not even the basic  descriptions of the different contents of the portal, has been  translated into English for the purpose of informing better a worldwide  community of interested historians. Internet is, above all, access to  global knowledge and the language of such a worldwide communication is  English today, a language that was indeed used for some of the papers  published  in the Zeitenblicke's overview of the EUI History Department's research activities.The issue is the result of an important initiative by some EUI history Ph.D. researchers. These promote the intellectual output and activities of the EUI History and Civilization Department dialogging  with some EUI history department members, professors and former professors. In doing so, they reproduced  in an online open access journal, the constant intellectual dialogue  that is happening between all components of the Department, Ph.D.  researchers, post-doctoral fellows, visiting scholars and professors,  during the whole academic year.The title of this Zeitenblicke monograph issue is "Current Historiographical Research at the European University Institute".  Interviewers and authors of this issue are EUI Ph.D. researchers:  Tilman Kulke, Moritz von Brescius, Robrecht Declercq and James White.  They are the authors of a global introduction to this issue: Diversity in Unity: An Introduction to Historiography at the European University Institute.Former EUI professors like Sebastian Conrad, Antonella Romano and Martin van Gelderen are interviewed together with the Head of the History Department, Federico Romero, Professor of History of Post-War European Cooperation and Integration and Jorge Flores,  Professor of History of European Colonial and Post-Colonial Systems and  Director of Graduate Studies in the Department.
