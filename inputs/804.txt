Just discovered a great blog post on âdata illustrationâ versus âdata visualizationâ at Information for Humans. AIS argues that data illustration is âfor advancing theoriesâ and âfor journalism or story-telling.â By contrast data visualization âgenerate[s] discovery and greater perspective.â I love this distinction, although Iâm not sure I like the specific language. Tukey famously argued that data visualization was for developing new theories. Drawing on Tukey, I would use the phrase âexploratory visualizationâ for techniques that allow us to poke around the data, searching for trends and patterns. TableauÂ is the great commercial product and Mondrian by Martin Theus is a wonderful freeware application. By contrast, once we have a thesis, we need to convince our audience. Thatâs âexpository data visualizationâ and it calls for different tools. The R package ggplot2 (http://www.ggplot2.org) is my choice. The terms âexpositoryâ versus âexploratoryâ resonate with freshman comp more that standard data analysis, but thatâs the point. After all, this is a DH blog.
