Last Thursday, Dave, John, and I went shooting. We a great time and poked numerous holes in targets (60 downârange myself) on the 100-yard range. After shooting, John took us to Pho Ha for huge bowls of Vietnamese noodles and we followed that up at Daveâs house with a few beers while we cleaned the rifles: .270, .223, .25â06, .65â06, .30â338 (x2), and a wildcat .458 Vincent. Which makes think the time has come to re-examine Sport Shooting, Hunting, and Conservation in American History.
