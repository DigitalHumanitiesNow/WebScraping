I'm very pleased, honored, humbled, and all-around chuffed to hear that Bill-Crit-O-Matic has won MLA's New Variorum Shakespeare Digital Challenge! (See post about building Bill-Crit-O-Matic) Many thanks to the committee, and to the various folks who gave it a quick look during the process of building it!Tags:Â mlavariorumbillcritomatic
