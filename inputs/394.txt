Serge Noiret (@sergenoiret) discusses the public dimension of the digital humanities on the Public History Weekly. […] the digital humanities provide methodologies and practices that, analogous to the sciences, are suitable for the humanities. These practices and concepts are elaborated within the various disciplines. Thus, after the digital turn, digital historians are confronted with new epistemological issues when analysing the past. […]Â Digitally connected historians do not perform their profession beyond the discipline: rather, they apply their methods, traditions, and skills to deal with primary sources in different contexts and to reconstruct the past using new types of narratives.
