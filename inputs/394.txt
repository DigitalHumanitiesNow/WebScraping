 I was hanging out with some colleague friends last week when I mentioned the NDSU field education credits I was working towards this semester. Part of my progressÂ towards that work is blogging my reflections teaching Word for the Wise: Writing for Religious & Social Change this semester at Concordia. Immediately, you could see the light bulb of recognition turn on for one of my colleagues. He had just figured out why, lately, Iâve been blogging so much about teaching and learning. And, I have to say, he looked a little bit crushed. Iâll be quite clear, then, that this is my last official post âfor creditâ as I reflect on teaching and learning, though Iâm sure there will be plenty of ânot for creditâ posts in the future. With that in mind, Iâm approaching it more scattershot than bullâs-eye. A few final reflections from my experimental course: In informal verbal feedback on the last day of class, students shared that they enjoyed being required to blog. They appreciated the change in audience from traditional papers, as well as the openness to different forms of writing. That noted, I could have improved the blogging work in at least two ways. First, I could have organized a central blog that curated all the studentsâ posts. I tried to figure out how to do this early in the semester and then gave up when other to-do lists took over. Second, I could have required students to comment on their classmatesâ blogs. The students themselves actually suggested this as a requirement. Students also asked for more guest speakers than the one I scheduled. I agree this addition would have improved the course. Plus, I would have enjoyed hearing more from local change agents as well! As an instructor, rather than always grading essays, Iâve really appreciatedÂ reading the diverse forms of student writing this semester. Particularly, and a bit strangely since they get a bad rap in the business world, Iâve really appreciated the studentsâ memos. For two assignments, I required memos, one for a project proposal and another for community engagement reflection. These were fun to read, and I hope studentsâ began to feel some familiarity with what was a new genre for them. One of my lingering course-related questions is how best to incorporate service learning into the classroom itself. As a whole, their community engagement work is quite solidly part of their coursework as students’ finalÂ project is a piece of writing for their service partner. So, itâs not like I said, âGo learn in the communityâ and never connected it to classÂ at all. But, I definitely could have made the connections stronger and more consistent. A factor that made quick-and-easy reflection difficult is the great diversity of studentsâ service learning sites, from schools to non-profits to churches. When discussing the course readingÂ list students wondered about dropping a bookÂ and replacing it with a spiritual memoir. Originally, I had considered teaching a spiritual memoir course this semester, so I was glad to hear their interest. Who knows, maybe Iâll get to teach spiritual memoirs, in one way or another, in my new position at Luther Seminary. Looking back, one way of reworking the course would more in-depth consideration of one (or a few) particular issues connected to religious and social change writing. For instance, approaching climate change, or human trafficking, or poverty, or racial injustice, or, well, I could go on forever. The point, though, is that having a two or three-week module considering writings on a specific issue would have been valuable. Thereâs much more I could share, but some of it shouldnât be on the interwebs for the world to see. Overall, however, I really enjoyed the course and so appreciate the studentsâ curiosity, creativity, and willingness to give a new course from a relatively new instructor a try. Now on to my next course design and syllabus instruction (up next semester: Money & Mission of the Church andÂ Christian Public Leader in Context). And, I promise, the blogging will continue, whether official or not. image byÂ Jared and Corin
