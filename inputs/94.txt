 I can't think of a better way to win friends on social than to writeÂ an article in which I bag onÂ LouieÂ and defend beat cops:  As any television critic will tell you, there are two constants when it comes to televised drama, âcopsâ and âdoctors,â and the current moment is no exception. For example, you have a wide selection of police procedurals to choose from: old hats like âLaw & Order: Special Victims Unitâ; more family-oriented fare like âBlue Bloodsâ; shows that are only tangentially about cops, but are still police procedurals, like âElementaryâ or âPerson of Interestâ or âBonesâ; and you even have comedies that work within the trappings of the police procedural, like âBrooklyn 99.â Except none of those are actually âcop shows,â because theyâre all about detectives. (Which is, yes, technically a rank, but is conventionally depicted as entirely different profession.) In fact, the majority of shows arenât about cops at all â theyâre about individuals too intelligent or talented to be lowly patrol officers, who have transcended the beat and work in the rarefied world of investigation. That is not to say that uniformed officers donât make an appearance on these series, because they do, but when theyâre not relegated to bit players at crime scenes â the blue drones in the background collecting evidence or being asked to canvas a neighborhood â theyâre inevitably fucking up. This dynamic was neatly encapsulated onÂ a recent episodeÂ of âElementaryâ â CBSâ loose adaptation of Arthur Conan Doyleâs Sherlock Holmesâ in which Joan Watson (Lucy Liu) is asked by the daughter of the New York Police Departmentâs Captain Thomas Gregson (Aidan Quinn) to assist her in breaking up a ring of thieves hitting up local drug stores. Hannah Gregson (Liza Bennett) is just a lowly uniformed officer, so she seeks out Watsonâs help â and Watson isnât even an actual detective, sheâs an assistant âconsulting detectiveâ â in order to discover the identity of the thieves, a problem thatâs been vexing Officer Gregson for weeks.    Two scenes later, Watson has not only discovered who the thieves are, but how to use them to infiltrate a much larger prescription drug smuggling operation. She hands Officer Gregson a file containing everything she needs to initiate what could be a career-making bust, and what does the beat cop do? She immediately arrests the low-level operators, thereby allowing those running the criminal enterprise to go to ground. Why does she do this? According toÂ her own father, Captain Gregson, itâs because sheâs not that bright â she settled for the small score because her beat-cop-brain isnât capable of conceptualizing the abstract connections required to take down a smuggling ring. âShe is what she is,â Captain Gregson tells Watson. âI love her, but I love this job too, the people who can actually do it.â And on that note, the episode fades to black, as if itâs a fact of precinct life that current uniformed officers just donât have what it takes to make detective. There is a reason that television prefers its âcop showsâ to follow detectives, and thatâs because thereâs an inherent narrative to the life of a detective, especially when they work in homicide â a life is taken, an investigation into who took that life ensues, discoveries of varying relevance are made and, if everything works out, a criminal or criminals with their own tales to tell is sussed out...  Believe it or not, thatÂ isÂ just the beginning.
