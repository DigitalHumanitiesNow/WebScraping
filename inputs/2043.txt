In this seminar I discuss an artefact-based approach to the study of early script using the         qualitative data analysis software, ATLAS.ti. Drawing on a case study of inscribed funerary objects from the Lower         Nile Valley dating to the period of Egyptian ‘state’ emergence (c.3200-2750 BCE), I consider the relationships         between physical expression and meaning.
