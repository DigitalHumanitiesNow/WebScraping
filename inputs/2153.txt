Iâve been using CATMA (http://www.catma.de/) to markup a text with some analytical tags Iâve created. I then exported the file in TEI, and Iâm now trying to extract the data Iâve marked up in order to measure tag frequencies, but am finding it quite difficult.  Rather than tagging text with the labels Iâve created, CATMA has established a somewhat complicated (though likely necessary) system of identifiers. So, for example, Iâve tagged the word âcloudsâ in my text with the tag âweather,â which is a child of the tagset ânon-living.â  CATMA represents the tag in the text like this: <text>      <body>           <ab type=âcatmaâ> Small feckless <seg ana="#CATMA_0036983F-4D37-48C2-8BC7-5846A8364D26">clouds</seg> were hurried across the vast untroubled sky...           </ab>      </body> </text> The identifier then points to this feature statement after the body of the text: <text>      <body>      </body>           <fs xml:id="CATMA_0036983F-4D37-48C2-8BC7-5846A8364D26" type="CATMA_3CDE1FE4-CA5D-4460-9BFF-739537D753DE">             <f name="catma_displaycolor">                 <string>-16710765</string>             </f>             <f name="catma_markupauthor">                 <string>name@email</string>             </f>         </fs> </text> The id for the type of the fs then points back up to the feature statement declaration in the header: <teiHeader>      <encodingDesc>           <fsDecl xml:id="CATMA_3CDE1FE4-CA5D-4460-9BFF-739537D753DE" n="2014-12-16T13:30:36.000+0000" type="CATMA_3CDE1FE4-CA5D-4460-9BFF-739537D753DE">                     <fsDescr>Weather</fsDescr>                     <fDecl xml:id="CATMA_699BAC76-8D15-408E-A30A-984849115A71" name="catma_displaycolor">                         <vRange>                             <vColl>                                 <string>-16710765</string>                             </vColl>                         </vRange>                     </fDecl>                     <fDecl xml:id="CATMA_8653855B-B611-48E8-AE9D-00E0160A37DB" name="catma_markupauthor">                         <vRange>                             <vColl>                                   <string>name@email</string>                             </vColl>                         </vRange>                     </fDecl>                 </fsDecl>      </encodingDesc> </teiHeader>  I need to extract the text and data, perhaps in a csv file (or other output format, if itâs easier), into something that lists the tagged text (e.g. âcloudsâ) in one column, the first tag applied to it in the next column (e.g. "weather"), and the tagset or category to which that tag belongs in the next (e.g. "non-living).  Or perhaps thereâs a better wayâreally, what Iâd like to be able to do is get the frequencies of each tag & tagset for each chapter. If thereâs an easier way to mark up the text in TEI that would better allow for what I need, Iâm open to re-encoding manually. Iâve also tried playing around a bit with some XSLT and a Python script (http://www.rdegges.com/quickly-extract-xml-data-with-python/) but with very little experience with either, I find myself quickly out of my depths. Open to suggestionsâand thanks in advance for your help!
