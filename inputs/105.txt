It is 4 a.m. I am alone downstairs, when all of a sudden, in the kitchen, I hear someone saying, âHello? Is anybody there? Hello?â âHello,â I reply, and walk in. No one is there â except for my cat, Virgil, who is sitting on the counter. I shoo him away, think it must have been the thunder, or the early hour, that confused me. Then my roommateâs phone rings, and goes to voice mail. Rings, and goes to voice mail. Rings, and goes to voice mail. Finally, I walk into the kitchen, grab his phone off the counter, and say, âHello, this is my roommateâs phone. Can I help you?â âIs everything OK?â a man asks. âWhy wouldnât it be,â I reply. âI got a call, heard strange noises, then a muffled voice calling for help.â I assure him that everything is OK, and he seems satisfied. As I place the phone back on the counter, I realize: GOD DAMN IT VIRGIL YOUR ASS JUST SCARED THAT POOR MAN HALF TO DEATH. THE END
