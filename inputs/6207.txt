Sometimes we hear of worthy projects for which funds are being raised, such as the Blake Society’s initiative to purchase Blake’s cottage in Felpham. Another, on a slightly smaller scale, came to our attention recently. The following is excerpted from the original message:  My name is Gaelen Armstrong â Iâm a Canadian metal artist currently residing in the US. My collaborator and I are admirers of William Blake, and weâre designing a project for reproducing BlakeâsÂ Ancient of DaysÂ as large copper bas reliefs. OurÂ Ancient of DaysÂ will be roughly 2′ x 4′ (x 3.5″, at its greatest depth), and will be pure copper. Weâll finish them with our handmade patinas and a variety of gold, silver, and brass brushplating. Each piece will be unique and substantial. We’ve made over 150 pieces of copper art together, and we’re excited to take on Blake’s masterpiece. Weâve created a Kickstarter campaign to cover the last few materials needed to bring the project to fruition. Though there are a variety of rewards for smaller pledges, those who pledge $1500 or more will receive their own 2′ x 4′ relief of theÂ Ancient of Days. As aÂ side note, pledges on Kickstarter are noted but no funds change hands unless the project meets its funding goal by the campaign’s deadline. (So there’s no risk of supporting a project that only gets partial funding, and therefore remainsÂ unfulfilled.)  The linkÂ for the campaign isÂ https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/350052336/william-blakes-ancient-of-days-in-copper-silver-an. It runs until 8Â May 2015.
