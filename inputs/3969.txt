Last week I made a post about the UNC student who allegedly received an Aâ for a 146 word plagiarized paragraph on Rosa Parks. I thought it smelled funny. Yes athletes are allowed to dodge hard college workâwho doesnât believe that? But this just smelled âoff,â for the reasons explained.  Well it turns out it was clearly not a final paper and the student received the Aâ for the entire course, not for the fragment of writing in the photo. Itâs not clear what the assignment actually was. Slate describes the project in detail here. Regardless of the state of academics in big time athletic programs, this is a perfect example of confirmation bias. If something comes to you with the phrase âcan you believe this?â attached or implied, the unspoken answer is always âyes, of course I can! I already do!â when it should be âprobably not.â The point of those things is to allow us to cluck over what we already know or believe. Itâs like melodrama in the theater, or professional wrestling; a broad, comic, cartoonish restatement of what we already believe. Although in historical analysis âprobably notâ is pretty much the default position. Whatever this source is saying, itâs probably not true, or not reliable, or not the way the author of the piece claimed.
