DigitalÂ Humanitarians sprung to action justÂ hours afterÂ the Category 5 Cyclone collided with Vanuatu’s many islands. This firstÂ deployment focused on rapidly assessing theÂ damageÂ by analyzingÂ multimedia content posted on social media and in the mainstream news. This request came directly from the United Nations (OCHA), which activated theÂ DigitalÂ Humanitarian Network (DHN) toÂ carry out the rapid damage assessment. So the Standby Task Force (SBTF), a founding member of the DHN, used QCRIâ²s MicroMappers platformÂ to produce a digital, interactiveÂ Crisis Map of some 1,000+ geo-tagged pictures of disasterÂ damage (screenshot below).  Within days ofÂ Cyclone Pam making landfall, the World Bank (WB) activated the Humanitarian UAV Network (UAViators) to quickly deploy UAV pilots to the affected islands. UAViators has access to a global network of 700+ professional UAV pilots is some 70+ countries worldwide. The WBÂ identified two UAV teams from the Humanitarian UAV Network and deployed them to capture very high-resolutionÂ aerial photographs of the damage to supportÂ the Government’s post-disaster damage assessment efforts. Pictures from these early UAV missions are available here. Aerial images &Â videos of the disaster damage were also posted to the UAViators Crowdsourced Crisis Map.  Last week, the World Bank activated the DHN (for the first time ever) to help analyze the many, many GigaBytes of aerial imageryÂ from Vanuatu. So Digital Jedis from the DHNÂ are now usingÂ Humanitarian OpenStreetMapÂ (HOT) and MicroMappersÂ (MM) to crowdsource the search forÂ partially damaged and fully destroyed houses in the aerial imagery.Â The OSM team is specifically looking at the “nadir imagery” captured by the UAVs while MM isÂ exclusively reviewing the “oblique imagery“. More specifically, digital volunteers are using MM toÂ trace destroyed houses red, partially damaged houses orange, and using blue to denote houses that appear to haveÂ little to no damage.Â BelowÂ is an early screenshot of theÂ AerialÂ Crisis Map for the island of Efate. The live Crisis Map is available here.  Clicking on one of these markers will open up the high resolution aerial pictures taken at that location. Here, two houses are traced in blue (little to no damage) and two on the upper left are traced in orange (partial damage expected).  The cameras on the UAVs captured the aerialÂ imagery in veryÂ high resolution, as you can see from the close up below. You’ll note two traces for the house. These two traces were done by two independent volunteers (for the purposes of quality control). In fact, each aerial image is shown to at least 3 different Digital Jedis.  Once this MicroMappers deployment is over, we’ll be using the resulting traces to createÂ automated featured detection algorithms;Â just like weÂ did hereÂ for the MicroMappers Namibia deployment. This approach, combining crowdsourcing with Artificial Intelligence (AI), is explored in more detailÂ hereÂ vis-a-vis disaster response.Â The purpose of taking this hybrid human-machine computing solution isÂ to accelerateÂ (semi-automate) future damage assessment efforts. Meanwhile, back in Vanuatu, the HOT team has already carried out some tentative, preliminary analysis of the damage based on the aerial imagery provided. They are also up-dating their OSM maps of theÂ affected islands thanks this imagery. Below is an initial damage assessment carried out by HOT for demonstration purposes only. Please visit their deployment pageÂ onÂ the Vanuatu response for more information.  So what’s next? Combining both the nadir and oblique imagery to interpret disaster damage is ultimately what is needed, so we’re actually hoping toÂ make this happen (today) byÂ displaying the nadir imagery directly within the Aerial Crisis Map produced by MicroMappers. (Many thanks to theÂ MapBox team for their assistance on this). We hope this integration will help HOT and our World Bank partners better assess the disaster damage. This is the first time that we as a group are doing anything like this, so obviously lots of learning going on, which shouldÂ improve future deployments. Ultimately,Â we’ll need to create 3D models (point clouds) of disaster affected areas (already easy to do with high-resolution aerial imagery) and then simply use MicroMappers to crowdsource the analysis of theseÂ 3D models.  And here’s a 3D model of a village in Vanuatu constructed using 2D aerial photos taken by UAV:  For now, though,Â Digital Jedis willÂ continue working very closely with the World Bank to ensure that the latter have the results they need in the right format to deliver a comprehensive damageÂ assessment to the Government of Vanuatu by the end of the week. In the meantime, if you’re interested in learning more about digital humanitarian action, then please check out my new book, which features UAViators, HOT, MM and lots more.
