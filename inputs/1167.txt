I take my major field exam on May 24th, at 10AM.  Only seven more weeks away. My preparation is going forward, slowly but surely. If you're wondering why I haven't posted much lately (or finished my Theme-A-Day week), that's one of many reasons why.  Another great history carnival was hosted by Patahistory, which I'm sure most of you have already checked out. The April 15th carnival is being held by (a)musings of a grad student, so send nominations to Rebecca at rgoetz[at]fas[dot]harvard[dot]edu or filling out a submission form. I embarassingly have about 1500 unread blog entries in my newsreader, which I'll hopefully get to read this weekend.
