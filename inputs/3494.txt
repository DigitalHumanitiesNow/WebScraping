I was an extremely early adopter of the Ruby programming language. In fact, Iâm pretty sure I own one of the first printings of the first pickaxe book.  Thereâs even evidence to suggest that I was one of the first people to teach a course in Ruby at the college level.  Iâm not often so ahead of the curve, but there it is.  I was way into Ruby way before it became fashionable.  And yet, somehow I managed to miss whyâs (poignant) guide to Ruby â an online tutorial on Ruby that comes close to being a graphic novel.  Thanks to Brett Barney of cdrh for pointing this out. He is obviously way, way, way ahead of the curve.
