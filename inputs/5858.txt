Today’s Gazette has a story in which I’m quoted about a new online service called Notesac (a rather unfortunate name). While it is mostly a banal case of a) students sharing notes and b) someone skimming profits off something at universities that wasn’t previously fully monetized, the real story here isn’t reported. The unfortunately-named “notesac” site claims ownership of the notes in a most problematic fashion: All documents (including the organization and presentation of such material) included in this web site (the “Documents”) are the property of NoteSac and its licensors and may be protected by intellectual property laws including laws relating to copyrights, trade-marks, trade-names, internet domain names, and other similar rights. The Documents many not be uploaded, sold or redistributed through any other mediums, specifically other websites, which are available to, or used by the public. The Documents may only be used for non-commercial personal or educational purposes. Copyright and other intellectual property notices must be observed at all times. Exploitation, modification, and creation of derivatives of the Documents are prohibited. The lectures are in the first instance the lecturers’ intellectual property, I don’t see how the company can claim exclusive property rights over their creation, distribution and sale, since their contributors may already be violating the IP terms of the courses they are attending.
