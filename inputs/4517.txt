Kristen Nawrotzki presented via videoconference to an international seminar on research and writing for historians of education at Canterbury Christchurch University, Canterbury, UK, on Friday, February 22nd, 2013. Â In a 20-minute presentation, she used examples from Writing History in the Digital Age to discuss ways in which Word Press with CommentPress can be used by and with student writer-researchers. Â WHDA was also presentedÂ as an example of how technology can enable collaborative scholarship and help historians – not least via open access publication — reach more and different readers for their work.
