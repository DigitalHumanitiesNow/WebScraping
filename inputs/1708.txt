An alley near 6th street in downtown Austin Texas. Photo taken during SXSW 2010. It is much brighter here than it appeared in the view finder. The sensor in a modern DSLR is better than our eye. It can basically see in the dark. What I didnât notice when shooting it (handheld, just walking by) is the group of guys. If you look at the full rez version you seeÂ  one of them, uh, relieving himself against the wall.
