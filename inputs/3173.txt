   Perhaps nothing better reflects the ambivalence of many people toward advances in science and technology than the co-presence of Gothic tales with science fiction. This is particularly true in the nineteenth-century, as early examples of science fiction were often indistinguishable from the Gothic genre. As Fred Botting observes, âGothic and science fiction share a fascination with the ruination of the species and the monsterous dissolution of the imaginary integrity of the human bodyâ (119). This course will trace the development of Gothic literature and science fiction in the nineteenth-century, paralleling their history with scientific developments that created anxiety in the human-centered nineteenth-century imaginary: James Hutton and Charles Lyellâs theory of deep time, William Herschelâs telescopic charting of an ever expanding cosmos, and Charles Darwinâs development of the theory of evolution. Course requirements include two presentation and a final 18-20 page seminar paper. Course Objectives.
