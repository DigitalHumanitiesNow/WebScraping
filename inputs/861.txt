 There are at least six different types of social media network structures present in systems like Twitter and other services in which people are able to reply to one another. Each of the six patterns is generated by the behavior of the individuals in the population. In many cases the pattern you are is not the pattern you want to be. This table describes each of the six patterns in terms of the difference between that pattern and the other five patterns. Go down the rows until you find the pattern that most closely matches the network you currently have. Â Then work across the columns until you find the pattern that you want to become. At the intersection is a color and a few ways to change and measure the transition from where you are to where you want to be. A red square indicates an undesirable transition (who wants to become a divided discussion?). Â A yellow square is a low probability and difficult transition (it is hard to go from divided to unified). Â A blue square is a challenge but possible while a green square is a fairly easy transition to make. Using this guide, you can plan a strategy for your social media engagement. This slide is part of a larger slide deck about using social media network analysis to guide engagement. Â Look for slide 71.
