Whatever else can be said of the PhD endeavor, it is fraught with anxiety and self-doubt. Everyone associated with graduate education knows this, many of us from first-hand experience, but rarely do we discuss it, and rarer still do we consider ways to ameliorate it. Perhaps it is in the nature of the endeavor itself. Extended PhD-level research often becomes so intimately bound up with our sense of ourselves that it is difficult to disentangle who we are from the work we do. This incapacity to distance our work from ourselves can turn every rejection into an existential crisis, every critique into a judgment of our value as a person. Or at least that’s how it can feel. In her article, The PhD experience: this far, and no further, Holly Else tells the stories of 5 PhD researchers who, faced with such feelings, either struggled to finish or decided to pursue another course of life. One morning a few weeks ago, John Gill tweeted a link to the article: "Some days I would sit down on the floor and just cry". Five brutally honest PhD stories: http://t.co/Hj976ULV8t via @timeshighered #phdchat — John Gill (@JG_THE) August 15, 2014  I read his tweet and the article as I was preparing for work that morning and responded: I wonder if the PhD always has to be so fraught with pathologies of self-doubt. What could we do to ameliorate that?@JG_THE @timeshighered — Chris Long (@deancplong) August 15, 2014  John turned the question back on me … @deancplong Interesting question. Do you have any thoughts? If so we'd be interested in discussing for a f/up article I'm sure… — John Gill (@JG_THE) August 15, 2014  And that began a wider conversation: @JG_THE Getting a PhD is difficult, so it's bound to draw out anxieties. We might start w/ more support systems that provide perspective. — Chris Long (@deancplong) August 15, 2014  Perspective It is easy to become so caught up in the life of your discipline and department that a wider perspective is lost. One reason we created the Graduate Internship Program in the College of the Liberal Arts at Penn State is to provide students with a broader perspective on university life and the institution that sustains their work. @deancplong @JG_THE I agree. More support is required, esp for new students. Mentoring by other students seems useful but is it practical? — Hannah Carver (@HanC_PhD) August 15, 2014  Hannah makes a good suggestion here. I do think peer mentoring can be an effective and practical approach. It might be worth considering creating more opportunities for cross-disciplinary mentoring to disrupt the insularity of discipline specific norms and cultures. Do we offer graduate students enough opportunities to engage socially and academically with students from other disciplines? Faculty Anxiety Faculty in general and junior faculty in particular experience similar feelings of anxiety and self-doubt, but these play themselves out differently in relation to the graduate students over whom they have significant authority. . @deancplong @JG_THE some of us have been asking this for a while. But the attitude persists that it's all about the student's weakness. — mÉlÉnij fÊlÉªk (@qui_oui) August 15, 2014  .@qui_oui @JG_THE Agreed, and the graduate experience is also bound up with faculty insecurities in complex ways. — Chris Long (@deancplong) August 15, 2014  @JG_THE @ruthiemacgee @deancplong Yes, I think profs feel it is an attack on them to frame the prob like this (but the prob persists) — mÉlÉnij fÊlÉªk (@qui_oui) August 15, 2014  Supervisor As Ruth McGinty points out, the role of an understanding, supportive dissertation supervisor can be critical. Take a look at the articles to which Melonie Fullick links on this issue. @ruthiemacgee @deancplong @JG_THE I wrote something on this http://t.co/wmYx0DtLHA + http://t.co/u6OoVOUVvg — mÉlÉnij fÊlÉªk (@qui_oui) August 15, 2014  Do we do enough professional development for dissertation advisors? Don’t show weakness Posturing in academia is endemic. A fear of seeming weak or ignorant or inadequate isolates us from one another. I admire the candor of Helene’s tweet on this: @qui_oui @deancplong @JG_THE agreed. Many times I was told by other grads to not talk about my fears and doubts. Would show weakness. — Helene Huet (@superHH) August 15, 2014  The pathologies of self-doubt and anxiety felt by so many graduate students is symptomatic of a corrosive culture of graduate education. What structures can we put in place or initiatives can we undertake to ameliorate the culture of anxiety that surrounds graduate education?
