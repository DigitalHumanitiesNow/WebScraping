Vienna University of Technology. Vienna, Austria June 3-7, 2015.http://summit.is4is.orghttp://summit.is4is.org/calls/call-for-participation Keynote speakers: http://summit.is4is.org/programme/speakers The  information society has come with the promiseÂ  to restore information  as a commons. The promise has not yet proven true. Instead, we face  trends towards the commercialisation and commoditisation of all  information; towards the totalisation of surveillance and the extension  of the battlefield to civil society through information warfare; towards  disinfotainment overflow; towards a collapse of the technological  civilisation itself. The Vienna Summit is a multi-conference and is at the same time the 5th ICTs and Society-Conference: The Internet and Social Media at a  Crossroads: Capitalism or Commonism? Perspectives for Critical Political  Economy and Critical Theory. Given that the information  society and the study of information face a world of crisis today and  are at a crossroads, also the future of the Internet and social media  are in question. The 5th ICTs and Society Conference  therefore wants to focus on the questions: What are the main challenges  that the Internet and social media are facing in capitalism today? What  potentials for an alternative, commonist Internet are there? What are  existing hindrances for such an Internet? What is the relationship of  power structures, protest movements, societal developments, struggles,  radical reforms, etc. to the Internet? How can critical political  economy and critical theory best study the Internet and social media  today? Presentations and submissions are organised in the form of  23 panel topics (ICT&S1-ICT&S23; please indicate the panel  identification number to which you submit in your submisison): * ICT&S1 The Internet and Critical Theory: What does it mean to study the Internet, social media and society today  in a critical way?
