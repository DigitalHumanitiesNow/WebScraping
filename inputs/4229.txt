Given the interest in alternative academic (alt-ac) careers and the remarkable variety these positions can take, I thought it might be helpful to others looking beyond the tenure-track if I were to provide a sense of what my particular instantiation of an alt-ac job entails. I am currently working on several noteworthy and new projects that will launch in the Fall or Winter Quarters. In this post, I highlight three projects and explain how my role in each requires (often vastly) different competencies. These three projects do not encompass everything I work on, but they do indicate some of the breadth and the multiple challenges I regularly have the good fortune to encounter.Lacuna StoriesThis summer, Amir Eshel, Edward Clark Crossett Professor of Humanistic Studies and Professor of German Studies and Comparative Literature, received a seed grant from Stanfordâs Vice Provost for Online Learning (VPOL) to develop a social reading platform for use in the classroom and, eventually, by the general public. He and Brian Johnsrud, one of Prof. Eshelâs graduate students and the project director, will use the software and materials we develop in a course that they will co-teach in the Winter Quarter on futurity. In the same quarter, Johnsrud and I will be co-teaching a complementary course about building in the Digital Humanities. Hereâs an abstract describing the project:The Lacuna Stories Project will create an exploratory, interactive, and collaborative online space where users can research and discuss significant historical events like 9/11. Lacuna Stories draws together primary source documents, fiction, scholarship, wikis, and user-generated forums and blogs. The online space extends current digital annotation software through functionality that encourages skills such as historical thinking, close reading, and comparison of media and sources concerning 9/11. When approached independently, individual sources, genres, and media inevitably fall short of stitching together the âwhole story.â Lacuna Storiesâ diverse, multi-media environment provides tools for instructors, students, and the general public to âmendâ the gaps in our knowledge of major historical events in order to develop their own narratives. User data generated through the siteâs design also will allow researchers to compare and better understand reading and engagement behaviors of students; along with other forms of user experience research and assessment, this research will provide directions for improving the platform and instructional materials.Johnsrud and I began informal conversations and email exchanges several quarters ago about annotation software and grant possibilities. Once Prof. Eshel and Johnsrud received their VPOL grant, they asked me to work more closely with them on the project, so I am now the project's Technology Director. In this capacity, I have been responsible for researching existing annotation platforms, evaluating their feature sets and technology stacks, choosing the best platform for our use cases and long-term sustainability (we settled on MIT HyperStudioâs AnnotationStudio), interviewing and directing developers and web designers, assisting with grant proposals, coordinating with the AnnotationStudio team, setting up servers, installing software to power wikis, blogs, and forums, among other responsibilities. Another part of my work on this project has consisted of balancing the need to have a working prototype ready for the Winter quarter with the research and pedagogical interests driving it, which has meant breaking down our goals into specific software features, prioritizing where our limited developer hours can be best deployed, and continuing to experiment with existing code bases and platforms to determine the best route forward. In the few short months this project has been funded, then, I have already worn many different hats.One of the many exciting features of this project is the way it joins instructional technology with research questions. The students who will be using the prototype we develop will also be asked to sign IRB consent forms so that we can study the usage data generated by their engagement with the platform. There are also two other faculty members other than Eshel involved in Lacuna Stories: Fred Turner, an Associate Professor of Communication, and Sam Wineburg, a Professor of Education and (by courtesy) History.Turnerâs research focuses on media, technology, platforms, American cultural history, and the cultural memory of violence. He will assist in implementing site elements that are comparable to other existing platforms (for control research purposes), data-gathering functionality for the platform based on registered users or IP-addresses of non-registered users, and other logistics that will allow user data to be generated from the site for future digital humanities scholarship.Wineburg is director of the Stanford History Education Group and co-creator of the award-winning website historicalthinkingmatters.org. He will assist in the pedagogical theory implemented for providing engagement with primary and secondary materials and expanding this goals of historicalthinkingmatters.org to suit the natively online, media-rich environment created by Lacuna Stories alongside practical and useful knowledge and skill-based assessment functionality and resources for instructors. In practice, his interests have led us to start developing new plugins for Annotator.js that will be able to support the teaching of historical thinking.Performing TrobarMarisa Galvez is an Assistant Professor of French who teaches a course on troubadour lyrics from medieval Occitan. My predecessor built a Drupal 6 web site to house course materials, student multimedia projects, assignments, image galleries, and audio files of song performances. Also intended as a public-facing resource, the site had become increasingly fragile and troublesome to work with as it aged. Working with Prof. Galvez over the summer of 2012, shortly after I began working at Stanford, I upgraded the site, added a lot of new functionality, and began preparing the site for the next time she would teach this course. Recently, we asked Michelle Jia, a Stanford undergraduate and valued member of Experimedia to review the site for possible user experience improvements and to give us a third-partyâs sense of what students will encounter. After looking over Jiaâs suggestions, I determined that it makes more sense to rebuild the entire site using latest stable version of Drupal (7) rather than continue adding components to an increasingly fragile structure based on a version of the software that will soon be deprecated.So, for this project Iâve been working as a systems administrator, database administrator, Drupal developer, web designer, and instructional designer as I think through how the technology and content model can support the types of multi-modal compositions that Galvez wants her students to create. For example, Iâm adding the ability to tag locations, create and link to bibliographies, translate content, generate timelines, and make comparisons between songs. When the course runs in the winter, I will also be running a complementary lab section for her students where I provide guidance on using the site to its fullest and, for students who want to go beyond what the site will support, choosing the proper technologies to implement the studentâs vision for his or her composition.For example, we want to allow students to translate medieval texts and view their peersâ different translations of the same text, while also being able to compare those to a more âcanonicalâ translation. To implement this ability, I must balance the affordances of Drupal with user experience and pedagogical concerns. To do so leverages not only my technical expertise, but also my teaching experience as I imagine how students and the instructor might engage with this part of the new site. Such decisions abound at every step.Digital Humanities Focal GroupI am also organizing with Dan Edelstein a Digital Humanities Focal Group (DHFG) that will promote faculty and graduate research in the digital humanities through lectures series, praxis workshops, curriculum, and the identification and development of digital humanities research projects, especially those eligible for grant-funding opportunities. The DHFG will also encourage research on literatures and cultures outside the usual ambit of digital humanities projects, which often focus on English-language texts from the 17thâ19th centuries. Indeed, many of the languages and cultures encompassed by the DLCL are underrepresented (if represented at all) in the digital humanities, in large part because of the prominence of English departments.In its first year, the DHFG will sponsor a lecture series and convene regular workshops alternating between praxis and theory. These activities will provide fora in which faculty and graduate students could share work in progress, discuss the state of the field, and identify important research that should be shared with the DLCL and broader academic communities. Crucially, the DHFG will promote digital research on underrepresented literatures and cultures to counteract the English-language dominance of much work in the field.We also plan to establish strategic partnerships with similar endeavors at Stanford such as the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis, the Literary Lab, HCI, etc. and with the larger academic community through organizations like the Association for Computers and the Humanites, the Praxis Network, and HASTAC.Out of these activities, the DHFG will identify and support promising research agendas through the conceptualization, funding, development, and publication/promotion phases. We expect they will also lead to formal curricular proposals.ConclusionVariety is one of the most rewarding aspects of my job. When I tire of one task (say, debugging code), I can move to another, like writing (grants, blog posts, articles, etc.), consulting with faculty and graduate students, building a web application, working on projects for the Stanford University Libraries proper, collecting data, or doing research. Iâm eager to see these three projects, in particular, come to fruition in the coming months and will provide updates on them as they develop.
