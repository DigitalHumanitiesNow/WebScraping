As many others have pointed out – on Twitter, in blog posts, and in person – this was a good year for digital at the AHA, and a great year for some wonderful and innovative digital projects.Â  I’ve been compiling a list of projects mentioned on Twitter and in panels, and I thought I’d share them here (in no particular order).Â  I’m sure it’s not complete- and that other wonderful digital projects were debuted and mentioned at the AHA.Â  I’d be happy to add to the list, if folks want to tweet their projects.
