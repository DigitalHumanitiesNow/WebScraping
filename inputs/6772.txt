The War on Learning: Gaining Ground in the Digital University is out!  Check out the first review (which appeared in Nature), a great three-part interview by Henry Jenkins, the official podcast, and this excerpt in Salon.com.  Many thanks to all of the colleagues who shared ideas and the many readers who provided feedback on the manuscript.
