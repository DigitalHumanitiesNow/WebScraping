The spring semester has finally passed, and now I'm moving on to things to come and things that I should have done previously. I'm sure I'll have to add to this, but this is what I have on my plate for this summer so far, in order of importance:   Six different projects for CHNM (more on that later).  My minor field statement for my History and New Media minor.  My field statment for my U.S. cultural history minor.  Preliminary dissertation research -- mostly secondary source reviews and some initial primary source searching.  Study for my major field exam with my partners in crime.  Finish review of Michelle Mitchell's Righteous Propagation for the North Carolina Historical Review.  Finish review of Lisa Lindquist Dorr's White Women, Rape, and the Power of Race in Virginia, 1900-1960 for the H-Net list H-SAWH (Women's and Gender history in the U.S. South).  Site redesign (more streamlining than anything). The code underneath this site is a real mess. And the CSS. Oh boy. I shudder to think how bloated it is.  Learn more PHP/MySQL. . Work on my history e-journal database. Have to learn more PHP first (see previous). . Submission for the CSS ZenGarden. Not too much, but I'll certainly be busy.
