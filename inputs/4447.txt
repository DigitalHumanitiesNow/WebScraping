Editing training at the event This month we are taking a look back at some of the Wikipedia gender gap projects we have worked on over the past couple of years. Today, we go back to July 2013… Back in July 2013 Wikimedia UK partnered with the Royal SocietyÂ and theÂ Medical Research Councilâs National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR)Â to celebrate the birthday ofÂ Rosalind Franklin, the scientist whose work laid the foundations for the discovery of the structure ofÂ DNA. This special event featured an opportunity to learn how to edit Wikipedia with a focus on articles about women in science. Eminent female scientists, includingÂ Professor Dame Athene DonaldÂ of Cambridge University, led a panel discussion and a presentation on the life and work of Rosalind Franklin. This event was part of a series to celebrate theÂ centenary of the Medical Research Council and experienced trainers and librarians were on hand to offer expert assistance. The day proved to beÂ a success, engaging new and experienced Wikipedia editors alike and 85% of attendees were female.
