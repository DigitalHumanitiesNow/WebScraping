Tastebuds are mostly back! Tuesday night I arrived home tired, and didn’t feel like cooking. t took out some left over tabbouleh from the weekend. I ate it and thought “wow, this tastesÂ good.” Â When I realized that 3-day old tabbouleh doesn’t usually taste better than newer tabbouleh, I went over to the butter dish, rubbed my finger on a little butter and tasted it. Â Wow! Â Butter! Â Then I tasted some salt. Â Wow! Â Too salty! Â So my taste appears to be mostly back. Â I’m still not sure I’d season food for other people but soon I’ll get up the courage to try. Today I ate a corporate burrito for lunch, which was surprisingly good, though it still has a certain number of errors that can only be called Canadian. Â For instance, it was grilled. The company may advertise “mission style burritos” but I have never had a burrito grilled for me in the actual Mission. Â At least the salsa wasn’t sweet (also a common problem in Quebec). The other problem with the burrito is that I bought it from a big corporation that has a deal with McGill, instead of from an awesome student group like I usually do, because the administration has put a stop to students selling burritos in the building next to mine.
