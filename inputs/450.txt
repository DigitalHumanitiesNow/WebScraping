If you missed it, we've got it, in this week's linkfest:Users not waking up to augmented reality mobile apps (via @jack_benott). Here's an interesting quote: Augmented reality "needs to move away from the "pull" model of using the camera to pull AR data to a "push" model where consumers can receive AR data in a seamless fashion". This theoretically will happen with the introduction of head up displays, but maybe we can't wait till then ...The augmented reality pitch that made Justin Timberlake invest in stealth startup Dekko (via @GaryPHayes). I really hope there's something more to it than this. I do love their chosen company name, though.I think Layar already did it, but 110 Stories is a Kickstarter project aiming to create an AR (and later physical) memorial the World Trade Center towers. Daqri's CEO Brain Mullins gives a keynote talk on San Diego's ARDevCamp titled "The state of augmented reality". I may or may not link to it just because I got quoted (but thanks!). "Inch High Stunt Guy" is not just a game, it also beautifully shows the power of Qualcomm's AR SDK.Smokers can get an augmented reality look at their dirty lungs (again via @GaryPHayes).And not exactly in AR this week: 16 creative QR codes, projection mapping on a face, Microsoft pays users to create a 3d reconstruction database.This week's video comes from Toyota Motor Europe and the Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design, which re-imagined a car's window for an excibition, and named it "Window to the World". The result is very attractive, as is evident by the half a million views this video got in the past last week. You probably have already seen it, but if not, here's a good place to read more about it.Have a splendid week!
