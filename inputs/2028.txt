This paper investigates movement and behaviour patterns of visitors to archaeological sites as a way of informing interpretive planning. A critical point was the development of a hybrid methodology for collecting and assessing data on movement around sites. I will demonstrate the methodology developed at the archaeological site of Gournia in Greece. Recognised forms of observation and the collection of qualitative data, and technologies such as GPS body tracking, geo-tagging and GIS applications were employed. The interpretation of the processed data provided better insight and an overview of the site’s affordances for movement and revealed the site's 'hot spots' according to visitors’ assessment.
