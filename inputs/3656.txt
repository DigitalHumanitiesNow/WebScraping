I just returned the copyedits for MP3: The Meaning of a Format to Duke. Â That was a ton of work for my RAs and I. Â I have no idea how I would have done it without them, given the intensity of the last month. Â  Thanks to their help I was able to do some last-minute rewriting and prettifying, and hopefully the text will be nice and shiny going into page proofs. Â I also added an epigraph from Lewis Mumford (he’s perfect for all occasions, like a good white wine), which I allowed myself since none of the chapters have epigraphs. Next up, putting The Sound Studies Reader to bed. Â Oh yes, and grading. Â And an end-of-term potluck for students.
