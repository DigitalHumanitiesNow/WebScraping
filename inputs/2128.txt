Open “MÃ¡quinas Pensantes” by Pedro Barbosa Barbosaâs theoretical-practical trilogy closes with MÃ¡quinas Pensantes: Aforismos Gerados por Computador [Thinking Machines: Computer-Generated Aphorisms] (1988), as it can be understood as the third volume of A Literatura CibernÃ©tica. Here, the author presents a long series of literary aphorisms, in which the generation of texts is said to be âcomputer-assistedâ (Computer-Assisted Literature) in BASIC language. The âAâ series (Re-text program) deals with combinatorial âre-textualizaÃ§Ãµesâ [re-textualizations] (1988: 59) of a fragment (âmatrix-textâ) by Nietzsche and the âBâ series (Acaso program), which had been partially published in the Jornal de NotÃ­cias (1984), draws upon the conceptual model created by Melo e Castroâs poem âTudo Pode Ser Dito Num Poemaâ [Everything Can Be Said in a Poem], included in Ãlea e Vazio [Chance and Void] (1971). Melo e Castro himself would write an early review on the aphorisms, in the ColÃ³quio Letras (1986) literary magazine, revealing Barbosaâs outputs as undeniable literary productions. Finally, the âCâ series (Afor-A and Afor-B programs) comprises reformulations of traditional Portuguese aphorisms, which result in new interpretations, sometimes ironic, sometimes surreal. One of the most important features of these three volumes is the highlight given to computer code â showing the importance of programming for Pedro Barbosa â inasmuch as in the end section of each volume the author publishes all the source codes, which today becomes a rich and open archaeological finding, insofar it documents the coding practice and it enables further critical and creative analysis.
