So you want to become a professor of Greek and/or Latin? Think hard about a PhD in Digital Humanities Gregory Crane (Alexander von Humboldt Professor of Digital Humanities at UniversitÃ¤t Leipzig & Professor of Classics and Winnick Family Chair of Technology and Entrepreneurship at Tufts University) Leipzig November 2o, 2014 I decided to write this piece because this is the time of year when those who wish to become professional students of Greek and Latin are deciding where they should apply for graduate schools. I am now starting to see that the most interesting Phd projects on Greek and Latin are taking place in PhD programs for the Digital Humanities and I think that anyone who wishes to develop a career of sustained satisfaction needs to think carefully about how they move forward. At the present time, I am not aware of any traditional program in Greek and Latin that prepares students for satisfying and sustainable careers. This essay falls into three parts. First I suggest some words of caution, including the well-known challenges about actually landing a permanent faculty position, the amount of work that you will need to commit if you want to maximize your chances for success and then, more substantively, something about the actual work that supports faculty Greek and Latin faculty positions in the United States and (much of) Europe. The second section briefly touches upon some fundamental topics that we must resolve if we are to rethink the study of Greek and Latin (as I think we must if we are to survive, or perhaps even flourish): the information that we produce, the knowledge that we internalize, the values that we advance and the basis for the survival of our field. The third section describes some topics that you will probably not find in a standard program for Greek and Latin but that would greatly enhance your ability to develop a sustainable career.
