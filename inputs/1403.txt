Yeah, it's been a while, but I think I worked harder over this break than I did this past semester. Most of my time has been spent writing some entries for an upcoming history encyclopedia and two chapters for a new edition of the History Highway, a book edited by Dennis Trinkle and Scott Merriman. Oh yeah, I also visited my family and my wife's family. I'm also glad to have a wireless mouse and keyboard (presents from my brother and aunt, respectively) hooked up to my G5 iMac.  If you haven't already seen it, go look at some of the blog posts that made Sharon's History Carnival #1. It's stuff like this that makes weblogging so cool, and it certainly motivates me to write better entries in my own blog. Thanks, Sharon!  I also finally made the new design of the Western Civilization Webography Project live this past week. If you teach Western Civilization and would like to sign up your class to use the site, contact Dr. Mills Kelly (tkelly7@gmu.edu) for more information.  One more thing. Dr. Paula Petrik and graduate students Kirklin Bateman, Sheila Brennan, and Douglas Mudd, all at George Mason University, created the Electronic Researcher last spring. The January 2005 issue of Perspectives, the AHA's newsmagazine, features an article by the group on their project. It's a great starting point for anyone using electronic tools (cameras, scanners, printers, image editing software and techniques) to collect research materials.   *[AHA]: American Historical Association
