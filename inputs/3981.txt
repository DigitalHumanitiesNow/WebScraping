Matthew Jockers has created syuzhet, âan R package for the extraction of sentiment and sentiment-based plot arcs from text.â The first CRAN release is available, and the package is on GitHub. Jockers has an introductory blog post on âRevealing Sentiment and Plot Arcs with the Syuzhet Packageâ which has a useful explanation of his method. Iâve been using the package myself for exploring sentiment and plot in the nineteenth-century publications of the American Tract Society.
