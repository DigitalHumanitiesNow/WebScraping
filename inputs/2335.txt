When I teach courses on Atlantic Slavery, we usually spend the final  weeks of the semester discussing popular ideas about the history of  slavery in the U.S.. Â In class discussions and in their blog posts,  students consider what they had been taught about slavery before taking  our class.Â  Drawing on a wide range of student experiences from touring  Gettysburg or Colonial Williamsburg on family vacations to the  presentation of slavery in elementary classrooms, we analyzed the  historical narratives teachers and park rangers constructed as well as  the implications these representations of Americaâs slaveholding past  have for contemporary discussions of race. Last fall, the students and I focused on the controversy over Our Virginia, the newly-adopted textbook for fourth-grade Virginia history.Â  In her analysis of Virginia during the Civil War, author Joy Masoff included a claim that âThousands  of Southern blacks fought in the Confederate ranks, including two black  battalions under the command of Stonewall Jackson.â When this  information about black participation to defend the Confederacy was  disputed by historians including Pulitzer Prize winner Jim McPherson,  Masoff revealed that her source was a website created by the Sons of the  Confederate Veterans.Â  In an effort to reshape the reputation of their  group and distance current members from the history of southern slavery,  their website presented the Confederacy as a struggle supported by  black and white soldiers alike. This case about the state-sanctioned presentation of history in the  classroom, coupled with readings from James Oliver Horton and Lois E.  Hortonâs 2006 edited volume Slavery and Public History: The Tough Stuff of American Memory,  brought many of the debates we had about the ongoing significance of  slavery and public memory.Â  If the goal of public history sites is to  get visitors to ask hard questions and see the past in a new way, how do  educators balance the need to engage visitors to support the project  with the need to present uncomfortable truths about slavery ands its  legacies? These discussions about slavery and public history were fresh in my  mind as I visited Ghana in May as part of the College of Wooster’s Hales Fund International Travel Seminars.Â  During the final days of our trip, we visited Elmina and Cape Coast castles.Â  How  would the Ghanaian government present the sitesâ histories to a diverse  audience of Ghanaians, African-American, and white tourists?Â  What would  be the tour guidesâ âtake-home messageâ about the contemporary and  historical significance of the Atlantic slave trade?Â  How would tourists  drawn to the site for so many purposes react? For the first section of the tour, the guide at Elmina emphasized the  horrors of the conditions in the holding dungeons.Â  The details of  captivesâ experiences of sexual violence, unsanitary conditions,  separation from family and friends, crowding, and the intense heat were  all too easy to imagine when faced with the physical site.Â  Centuries  later, the stench of the suffocating air in the dungeons lingers. Having  visited many other Portuguese forts, I was awed by the sheer size of  Elmina.Â  The structure is massive â certainly many times larger than  contemporary military forts in Bahia or Rio de Janeiro, suggesting its  central importance to the early Portuguese colonial empire.Â Â Â  On the  dungeon floors, we saw the floral wreaths honoring the many slaves who  died before and during the Middle Passage.Â  The guide told stories of  resistance, and the harsh punishments that awaited men and women who  fought back.Â  The physical impact of the space created a profound sense  of empathy with the Africans sold into slavery here.Â  I was impressed by  the emphasis on Elmina as a site to bear witness. Unfortunately, our guideâs final summing up left me more cynical  about the Ghanaian tourist boardâs presentation of Elmina as a historic  site.Â  With his tourist audience clearly in mind, our guide finished  with a plea for the need for forgiveness and racial unity.Â  We should  leave history and especially the need to place blame for the atrocities  he had described behind, and instead work together for a better future.Â   Although I was prepared after reading Bayo Holsey’s Routes of Remembrance for a discourse that distanced contemporary Ghanaian life from the  history of the trade, and I recognized the difficulty with constructing a  narrative that would speak to his diverse audience, I was still  disappointed with what seemed to me like such blatant pandering. Â For  me, the message that we needed to âforget the pastâ betrayed the  emotional power of the site, the stories of suffering and courage, and  the continuing legacies of European imperialism in contemporary Ghana. The site included a display highlighting the âimpacts of European   contactsâ, including âEducationâ, âEuropean languagesâ, âReligionâ, and   âMultiracialismâ, illustrated with photos of light-skinned Ghanaian  families. And yet this depoliticized message was itself formulated in response  to the need to market Elmina as a tourist site appealing to a national  and international audience.Â  When members of our group asked our guide  about how he formulated the final section of his tour, he acknowledged  that it was largely in response to complaints from European tourists who  felt they were blamed for the slave trade.Â  Ghana needs the tourist  dollars that are their fourth largest source of foreign income.Â Â  And as  our photos from touring Cape Coast show, not all Ghanaian young people  view the sites with the same sense of reverence that Diasporian visitors  do. Â Exposing as many visitors as possible to the site itself seems key  to honoring the memory of those who died there and pushing the visitor  to ask new questions about the historic legacies of the trade.
