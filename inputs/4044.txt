St. Catherineâs Hill, by Darren Johnson by Adam Crymble (BHO Project Manager) I got an email this morning from one of the readers of British History Online. It was from a 90-year-old lady in South Africa who expressed her delight at being able to read about her childhood home in Surrey. She had wanted to express her gratitude for having a resource like British History Online that Â evoked memories from the better part of a lifetime ago, from thousands of miles away. This email was the first piece of feedback from a reader Iâd received since taking over a few weeks ago as the new Project Manager. Iâd like to think it will all be that easy â perusing nice letters from satisfied users of our collection. But Iâve learned quickly that thereâs plenty of work to be done. Allow me to introduce myself. Iâm Adam Crymble. Like many of you, I fancy myself a bit of a historian, be that amateur or professional. Iâve done some traditional historical work, both as a family history researcher and in an academic setting teaching Early Modern British history at Kingâs College London (where I did my PhD in 18th century British history). And Iâve also had a fair bit of experience building websites over the years. Iâm hoping to combine those interests to continue to bring a great and expanding set of resources to you that you can trust, via the British History Online website. Stepping into a project thatâs been running for more than a decade can be a bit daunting. Thereâs already so much content here that I need to get my head around. So many great ideas that have already been implemented. But thereâs also places we can grow. The big task for this year is to help the rest of the team put together a new website to hold our content. The web has changed a lot in the last few years, and weâre excited about the possibilities of making the website even easier to use and make the content even easier to find. Weâre also excited about a number of new partnerships weâre pursing that we hope will bring even more great historical resources to the web for the first time. Iâd like to invite you to get in on the ground floor of that initiative by supporting our collectionâs growth, either by subscribing to the siteâs premium contentÂ (Â£30) or by making a donation to our digitisation fund. 2014 promises to be a great year for British History Online. Iâm pleased to be a part of it, and Iâm looking forward to working with you as we build the best collection of British History on the web.
