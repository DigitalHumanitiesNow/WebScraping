Please join us at MITH on April 30th between 11-12 for a conversation  with Katrin Weller about some of the methodological challenges around studying Twitter. Weller is a postdoctoral researcher at GESIS Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences in Cologne, Germany. At GESIS she is working in the field of Computational Social Science, focusing of ways to make use of social media data for social science research. She currently holds one of the first Digital Studies Fellowships at the Library of Congressâ€™ John W. Kluge Center. In this talk she will provide insights into some of her ongoing projects, e.g. illustrating different ways to study Twitter (see Weller et al., 2014, Twitter and Society) and the methodological challenges around this. The talk will also include first results from a series of interviews with researchers from different disciplines on their experiences in working with social media data (project The Hidden Data of Social Media Research, Weller & Kinder-Kurlanda).
