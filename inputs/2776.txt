I have wanted to blog for some time, but I have not had the courage to do so, at least until now. I have had a RSS reader for several years now (make that 6 years) and have followed many in the web standards and digital humanities spheres. I think fear was the biggest stumbling block for me, fear of judgement, etc. However, this year I asked my digital humanities students to blog. I could not in good faith require my students to blog if I did not blog myself. Thus, I bit the proverbial bullet and added a blog to my site. So far, I am finding it a rather enjoyable experience (though one I have not had much time to do). Many of the students in my class have also found that blogging was not something they had considered before, but are now finding their blog an intriguing addition to their work as scholars (as well as anxiety producing one): What to Write, Entering the Blogging World, Posting, and Coming to Terms with Blogging. In addition to these posts, Cameron Blevins recently made some very good points about blogging as an important part of his intellectual and community building experience within academia and digital humanities in particular. Only time (and good posts) will tell if I, too, find blogging helpful in connecting me to a wider world. Ultimately, I hope that the students from my class find blogging as good a tool as Cameron does in building intellectual and community connections within their own respective spheres as well as outside those spheres. So far, it appears that they are finding it so.
