The excitement about "Big Data" is usually around the access to lots of data -- thousands, or millions, of records.  Below is a hairball diagram of lots of social data (nodes and links revealing a network of connections) from the WWW.  Social data is not like most big data.   It is relational/interdependent, not discrete/independent like most big statistical data about individual people and objects.Social data is not like most big data.  This picture below is not that useful!  What we want is interesting and useful, not BIG.Big Data HairballWe apply an software MRI to our big data hairball above.  We now see various subsets of the data mass -- shown below.  Notice the network components displayed below are all in the size range of dozens or hundreds of nodes. We now see networks & communities worth investigating.  We can now answer useful questions.Who is here? What are they connected about -- what are the links? Where are the communities -- why did they cluster?Who is in the thick of things?Who connects the communities?The networks below are all sub-nets of the hairball above. They are communities that emerged around common interests, goals, knowledge, affinities, etc.Sub-network #1Sub-network #2Sub-network #3Sub-network #4Sub-network #5Sub-network #6When investigating social/relational data, it is usually not the forest that is useful, but the clusters of various trees, and their relationships, inside the ecosystem. We not only want to "see the forest for the trees", but also see the patterns/clusters of trees in the forest! Big data often contains small clusters -- especially with social data.  Human networks usually contain dozens or hundreds of nodes -- we usually do not have time/energy for thousands or millions of friends/colleagues!  Facebook's own research showed that people who claim hundreds or thousands of friends, regularly interact with only dozens of them. The goal is not to analyze the universe of data, but to to find the significant clusters within all of that data.  At 10,000 meters, big data is not that interesting.  At 1000 meters, we start to see patterns/clumps. At 10 meters we can play with emergent clusters that have real meaning and we start to learn what is happening inside our social ecosystem.  In Big Data, the important numbers are not the millions, but the many sub-groups of dozens, hundreds, and maybe thousands that reveal meaning, and give us insight.What is happening in the "social clusters" inside your ecosystem?
