I have been learning how to use higher-order functions in XQuery.  I am using the eXist system to test this.  To do this you will need to get the 1.3 build that there is no download for (yet).  Here are the steps I used:  Download fresh copy of eXist from svn via TortoiseSVN or Eclipse subversion subclipse plugin from the eXist SVN sourceforge repository:  https://exist.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/exist  (Confirm environmental variables are set correctly for JAVA_HOME and EXIST_HOME)  To do this I use the Windows/Computer/Properties/Advanced Settings and check it with the SET command at the CMD prompt.  The result looks like this:  JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_10   My Eclipse workspace is just "C:\ws" and I created a project called eXist-1.3 so the path name I used for EXIST_HOME is:   EXIST_HOME=C:\ws\eXist-1.3dev   Open the DOS cmd prompt, cd to eXist directory type in "build.bat" Type in "build.bat -f build\scripts\jarsigner.xml"   It took just 1 minute and 6 seconds for the main build to run on my 4CPU system with 8GB of RAM even though it is running Vista.  Then I just ran the start.bat in the bin directory.  eXist was then running on http://localhost:8080/exist.  I had to use the new WebStart admin tool on the admin section of the eXist web page to change the admin password.  Thanks to Joe Wicentowski at the US Dept of State for helping out!
