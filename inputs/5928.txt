Carrie was out for a walk this afternoon with some of the other fellows.  The street by the Center was closed off and Obama’s motorcade drove by on the way to Facebook.  He’s apparently a commanding presence in real life, in a car, driving by.  They waved to him, he waved back.  I told her to update her facebook status so she could be facebooking that she saw the president on the way to facebook.
