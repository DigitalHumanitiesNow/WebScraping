In his famous essay on âHistory as a Literary Art,â Samuel Eliot Morrison advises, âWhen you once are writing, go on writing as long as you can; there will be plenty of time later to shove in the footnotes or return to the library for extra information,â and, âDonât stop to consult your notes for every clause or sentence: it is better to get what you have to say clearly in your mind and dash it off; then, after you have it down, return to your notes and compose your next few pages or paragraphs.â I try to follow this advice when Iâm writing by leaving notes or markers in the text when Iâm missing a fact or a reference. Following up on my post about Vim yesterday, here is how I manage these markers in Vim. First, I insert the markers in a standard form: {TODO} is my generic marker; {PAGE} marks a missing reference; {FACT} marks a missing date or the like. I insert these markers using vim-snipmate but any method will do. Second, I use the line below to highlight these markers in the text. I have the line in ~/.vim/after/syntax/pandoc.vim, but you could also put it in your .vimrc. match Error '{\w\+}' The result looks like this:  These markers then come in handy when itâs time to clean up the draft. I could search for the markers, but this keymapping makes things easier: nnoremap <leader>{ :vimgrep /{\w\+}/ %<CR>:copen<CR> That keymapping puts all of the markers into Vimâs quickfix buffer, which gives me a list of all the needed corrections and lets me jump from item to item. It looks like this:
