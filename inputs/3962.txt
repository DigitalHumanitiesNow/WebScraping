Learn to receive criticism well before preaching others to do the same.The single greatest enemy of a good thesis is the dream of a perfect thesis.A scholar is an an exemplar rather than a crusader.Dichotomies are a seductive danger.Work to change the world, but don't martyr yourself for the ungratefulIn almost all circumstances, your intuition cannot fully grasp the complexity of an issue.Root out logical inconsistencies.Make peace where you can.You cannot solve problems you cannot see.Never be satisfied if and when your position finds contingent sympathies.If in your version of history nothing happened, your account is likely flawed.Abandon reductionism of any form and favor seeing social phenomena in their dynamic totality.Never confuse simple with simplistic.Seek the the limits of a concept's utility.The world is bigger than one method.When public speaking, the larger the audience, the slower you should go.You cannot defend a position you do not understand.
