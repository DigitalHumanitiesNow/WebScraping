A new course for the Digital Studies program at Davidson College. Influences for the syllabus abound: Lisa Gitelman, Lauren Klein, Ben Schmidt, Matt Wilkens, and many other folks in the digital humanities. Course Description âDataâ is often considered to be the domain of scientists and statisticians. But with the proliferation of databases across nearly all aspects of modern life, data has become an everyday concern. Bank accounts, FaceTime records, Snapchat posts, Xbox leaderboards, CatCard purchases, your DNAâat the heart of all them is data. To live today is to breathe and exhale data, wherever you go, online and off. And at the same time data has become a function of daily life, it has also become the subject ofâand vehicle forâliterary and artistic critiques. This course explores the role of data and databases in contemporary culture, with an eye toward understanding how data shapes the way we perceiveâand misperceiveâthe world. After historicizing the origins of modern databases in 19th century industrialization and census efforts, we will survey our present-day data landscape, considering data mining, data visualization, and database art. We will encounter nearly evangelical enthusiasm for âBig Dataâ but also rigorous criticisms of what we might call naÃ¯ve empiricism. The ethical considerations of data collection and analysis will be at the forefront of our conversation, as will be issues surrounding privacy and surveillance. Learning Goals Upon completion of DIG 210, students will be able to: Develop a timeline of the rise of databases Compare the symbolic power of databases in contemporary life with their functional role Analyze a data set with one the common digital tools for data analysis and visualization Appraise arguments for and against âBig Dataâ as an interpretive mechanism Experiment with the way identities are constructed through data Evaluate competing claims about the ethical collection and use of social data Required Reading Various journal articles, book chapters, and online material, available through the library, Moodle, and the class website Required Work The graded work for DIG 210 will take several forms, detailed below: (1) class participation; (2) weekly blogging; (3) a data critique; (4) a âdistant readingâ using data analysis tools; and (5) a data-based project. (1)Â  This class places a high premium on participation. It is essential that everyone has carefully considered the dayâs material, attends class, and participates. I also expect students to bring the dayâs readings to class, well-marked up with notes and annotations. Daily attendance is crucial for full participation. More than two absences will lower your class participation grade by at least one letter grade. More than five absences will result in a zero for your class participation grade. Participation is worth 20% of the final grade. (2)Â  Each student will contribute to the weekly class blog. There will be three roles on the blog, and each week a quarter of the class will rotate through these roles (one group has the week off in terms of blogging). Students in one group (âReadersâ) will post an approximately 250-word critical response to the weekâs reading by Monday night at 10pm. Students in another group (âRespondersâ) will either respond to these posts or to our classroom discussion by Wednesday night at 10pm. A third group (âObserversâ) will obsessively collect data about our class, ranging from the trivial (e.g. the number of people wearing red one day) to the substantive (e.g. the type of questions asked during a class discussion). The observers will then post this data onto our class blog at the end of every week. Blogging is worth 20% of the final grade. (3)Â  The data critique is a close analysis of a large dataset, in which you investigate its sources, how it was collected, issues around privacy or ethics that come into play, the uses to which the data is put, and the ways it represents âtruthâ or âfacts.â The data may be impersonal, such as census statistics, or it may be data that is closer to home, such as the Davidson residential hall energy usage, or even data about your Facebook network. The critique will be accompanied by a reflective statement. The data critique is worth 20% of your final grade. (4)Â  The distant reading is playful attempt to construct meaning from a set of data without engaging the data on a local level. For example, you might âreadâ an unfamiliar Victorian novel by running it through various text analysis tools. Or you might create a network visualization of a hashtag. The distant reading will be accompanied by a reflective analysis of your distant reading and its methodology. The distant reading is worth 20% of your final grade. (5)Â  The data-based project is not a database; rather, it is an opportunity to reconfigure a set of data into an argument about that data. In other words, your task is to transform an existing data setâthrough the interface, its visualization, and so onâin a way that highlights some underlying argument you want to make about the data. The project can be speculative, in the form of a mock-up or proof-of-concept. The data project will be accompanied by a 3-4 page analysis of your project. It is due at the end of the exam period, but you may hand it in earlier. The data-based project is worth 20% of your final grade. Grading The final grade will be calculated in the following manner: Participation: 20% Blogging: 20% Data Critique: 20% Distant Reading: 20% Data-based Project: 20% I will evaluate the blog posts according to the following 0-4 point scale: RATING CHARACTERISTICS 4 The blog post is focused and coherently integrates examples with explanations or analysis. The post demonstrates awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers multiple perspectives when appropriate. The post includes at least one rhetorically useful image or media clip that illustratesârather than trivializesâits point. 3 The blog post is reasonably focused, and explanations or analysis are mostly based on examples or other evidence. Fewer connections are made between ideas, and though new insights are offered, they are not fully developed. The post reflects moderate engagement with the topic. 2 The blog post is mostly description or summary, without consideration of alternative perspectives, and few connections are made between ideas. The entry reflects passing engagement with the topic. 1 The blog post is unfocused, or simply rehashes previous comments, and displays no evidence of student engagement with the topic. 0 No Credit. The blog post is missing, late, or consists of one or two disconnected sentences. Every other assignment will be given a letter grade that has a percentage equivalent: A = 95% /A- = 90% B+ = 88% / B = 85% / B- = 80% C+ = 78% / C = 75% / C- = 70% D+ = 68% / D = 65% /F = below 60% Inclusive learning I am committed to the principle of inclusive learning. This means that our classroom, our virtual spaces, our practices, and our interactions be as inclusive as possible. Mutual respect, civility, and the ability to listen and observe others carefully are crucial to inclusive learning. Any student with particular needs should contact Nance Longworth (x2129), the Academic Access and Disability Resources Coordinator, at the start of the semester. The Dean of Studentsâ office will forward any necessary information to me. Then you and I can work out the details of any accommodations needed for this course. Academic Integrity Students at Davidson College abide by an Honor Code. The principle of academic integrity is taken very seriously and violations are treated gravely. What does academic integrity mean in this course? Essentially this: when you are responsible for a task, you will perform that task. When you rely on someone elseâs work in an aspect of the performance of that task, you will give full credit in the proper, accepted form. Another aspect of academic integrity is the free play of ideas. Vigorous discussion and debate are encouraged in this course, with the firm expectation that all aspects of the class will be conducted with civility and respect for differing ideas, perspectives, and traditions. When in doubt (of any kind) please ask for guidance and clarification. Classroom Courtesy While this course embraces the digital world it also recognizes that digital tools and environments complicate personal interactions. Studies have shown that students who use laptops in class often receive lower grades than those who donât. Even more worrisome are studies that show laptop users distract students around them. I permit laptops and tablets in class, but only when used for classroom activities, such as note-taking or class readings. Occasionally I may ask students to turn off all digital devices. Text messaging or other cell phone use is unacceptable. Any student whose phone rings during class or who texts in class will be responsible for kicking off the next class dayâs discussion. Late arrivals or early departures from class are disruptive and should be avoided.
