Michael Widner surveyed the faculty of the Division of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages about their research, teaching, and collaboration. From this information, he generated several network graphs for use in an all-faculty retreat at which the agenda was to center around how the DLCL is structured and how well it works for faculty. To learn more about this project, read Michael&#8217;s blog post on the visualization. You can also explore the networks.
