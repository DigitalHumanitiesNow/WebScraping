  5.14.12 | at desk I recently came across another mapping project for The Green Book, developed and hosted by the University of South Carolina Libraries. The programmer, Matthew Sheppard, who is a MLIS candidate, mapped theÂ  Spring 1956 edition* of the Green Book that the libraries had digitized, on the Google Earth platform. You can see the results in real time by clicking the image above.Â  In their application, you can filter the map data by building type–Motels, YMCA/YWCA, Hotel, etc., or search by address. As with all Google Earth maps, you can zoom in and out on the areas that particularly interest you. The USC map is really useful as a snapshot of sites at one historical moment–1956–and it immediately demonstrates how a national- or regional-scale map can reveal patterns of leisure and mobility.Â The map also illustrates some of the problems I’ve found with the Google platform (which the developer also encountered)in terms of creating “good data”–i.e. precise locations for historical addresses. Many of the street addresses in the GB are no longer extant or have been re-assigned. That, coupled with using a contemporary base map (rather than one from 1956) creates a situation where you have only a sense of where things were.Â  Secondly, and this is my personal bias, I find the GE interface to be inelegant and cluttered, even when there is just a minimum of data shown, as there is in this map.Â  I imagine that if you started including multimedia files–video, audio, photographs, etc–it would quickly become a headache to look at and work with. There is, and this is true of all free, public web mapping applications, a lack of customization that makes the interface hard to read.Â It’s like everyone in the room is talking at the same pitch, and that pitch is just a hair…shrill. That said, its fantastic to see the Green Book visualized as spatial data, and I was really encouraged by it and interested in seeing what they do next. Aside from the fact that it was great to discover other people who are interested in this subject and its spatial consequences, it helps me to understand how important the analytical piece of this project will have to be. Next week, I am going to start to focus on California, in preparation for the NEH Summer Seminar at UCLA in June. Â * There is only one year that I know of when the Green Book did Spring and Fall editions.
