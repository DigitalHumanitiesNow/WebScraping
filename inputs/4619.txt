In the summer of 2015,Â fromÂ July 26 to August 2, a partnership of 23 liberal arts institutions will hostÂ ILiADS, the Institute for Liberal Arts Digital Scholarship, at Hamilton College in Clinton, New York.Â ILiADSÂ offers participants two ways to engage the community of liberal arts practitioners and pedagogues: a team- and project-based approach and a more traditional conference structure. Those interested in the project-based component, with ideas or teams at any stage (or no stage!) of development, are encouraged to let our planning consultants guide their participation.
