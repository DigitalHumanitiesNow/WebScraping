It’s true, in the new year I’ll be giving a talk at the University of South Florida’s Humanities InstituteÂ on The Emergence of the Digital Humanities, and including a section on my new project on the emergence of humanities computing in the mid twentieth century. Â Free and open to the public: January 20, 2015, 6:00 PM.
