interface2014: Interface 2014 Transmediating CultureÂ Institute for Comparative Studies in Literature, Art & Culture Carleton University, Ottawa ON May 2-3, 2014 The transmediation of a work is never a simple duplication. InÂ My Mother Was a ComputerÂ (2005), Katherine Hayles argues that the transformation of a work into a new medium is a kind of translation, and therefore an interpretation. This act of translation has significant consequences for our understanding of a work. While the accessibility of new digital media has elevated concerns about the implications and applications of transmediation across disciplines in the arts, its relevance pertains not only to digital, but to material works as well; for example, the relocation of art into new contexts, adaptation, and parody. This yearâs conference aims to explore the impact of transmediation on both material and digital works. We invite submissions on a broad range of topics that explore questions of transmediation and the consequences of this process for narrative, representation, and interpretation. Possible topics may include, but are not limited to:- Adaption (animated, film, game, graphic, literary, mobile, etc.)- Appropriation- Critical artistic works- Cross-platform media franchises- Digital editions- Education and transmediation- Fan art- New media art- Parody- Transmedia storytelling and other transmedia projects Paper proposal submissions should be sent toÂ interface.conference2014@gmail.comÂ and contain information such as your name, status, institutional affiliation, paper title, and brief biography (100 words).
