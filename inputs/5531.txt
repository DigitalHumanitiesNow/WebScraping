I’m incredibly excited to announce that I’ve accepted a position as an associateÂ professor in the School of Education at Iowa StateÂ University starting this summer. I’ll be teaching and advising students in the Student Affairs graduate program. Many of you who follow this blog know that I started a new position in the Purdue University Libraries this past year. I have enjoyed my time at Purdue– the Libraries faculty are a dynamic and interesting bunch. My explorations of information literacy from an information science perspective will forever influence my research. Not to mention that Purdue is a great institution (and a really cool college town). I have often heard from student affairs professionals who want to begin a Ph.D. to focus on social media/emerging technologies but have hesitated because no programs focus on such issues. Now is your chance to come work with me! Not only will I be continuing my research on how new technologies influence student development, but I’m joining an already impressive and vibrant community of scholars at Iowa State. We’ve also got two new assistant professors joining us in the fall whose research focuses greatly on social justice issues. Drop me a line to learn more or find me at #ACPA14
