As our state legislature churns around the biggest educational issues that will be taken up this session, I’d like to invite everyone to the middle. Partisanship has driven us to our separate corners in a conversation where there is a tremendous amount of room for agreement. While I can appreciate the deeply held beliefs on which each side of the aisle stand, I’m asking you each to consider what one, two or three steps you can make toward consensus. Inaction is unacceptable and sentences our already floundering system to another year of churning and stalling.  We can’t lose another year in the necessary work of transforming learning in Iowa. We can't let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of good.
