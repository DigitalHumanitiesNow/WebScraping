We are pleased to announce the release of the Posters plugin, which allows guest users to add, edit, share, print, or delete their own collections of public content from your Omeka site. This is the much-anticipated update of the posters function of MyOmeka, a plugin from version 1.5.  Posters requires the plugin GuestUser; together, these plugins allow individuals to sign up and create posters without editing the items on your site. Guest users can describe their poster and add a short caption to each item. Because users log in to create a poster, they can come back any time to reorder items, add or delete content, and change descriptions. Learn more about how it all works in the documentation.    Posters is fun and easy to use. Itâ€™s a great way to allow students or visitors to remix the content of your Omeka site.
