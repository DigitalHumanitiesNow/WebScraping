We’re both pleased and grateful to announce that Microsoft Research has given $10,000 in support of THATCamp. An early sponsor of THATCamp Pacific Northwest, Microsoft Research has now made funds of up to $500 available for sixteen separate THATCamps. These funds will be administered and distributed by THATCamp Central at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. If you are organizing a THATCamp in the U.S. and are interested in receiving these funds, please write *protected email* for details.MS Research has supported the work of Internet ethnographer and privacy scholar danah boyd, has produced such useful open source tools for the humanities as ChronoZoom, and has organized an annual Faculty Summit for the express purpose of bringing academic researchers and educators together with Microsoft’s computer scientists and engineers. We’re proud to be associated with them. Special thanks are due to Donald Brinkman, program manager for the Digital Humanities at MS Research, whose vision made this happen.
