Cross-posted from Day of DH Wasting Gold Paper…  Iâm up early on this Day of DH 2014. So much to do! I thought Iâd introduce myself to you all, so you have an idea of my background. Iâm not your typical DH practitioner â Iâm not in the academy (in a traditional way) and Iâm also not working with Western-language materials. My concerns donât always apply to English-language text or European medieval manuscripts. So, if you looked in Asia Iâd be less remarkable, but here in the English-language DH world I donât run across many people like myself. Anyway, good morning; Iâm Molly, the Japanese Studies Librarian at University of Pennsylvania, also managing Korean collection. That means that I take care of everything â from collection development to reference and instruction â that has to do with Japan/Korea, or is in Japanese/Korean at the library and beyond.  Letâs start off with my background. I went to college at University of Pittsburgh for Computer Science and History (Asian history of course) and studied Japanese there for 4 years. I fully intended at the outset to become a software developer, but somewhere along the line, I decided to apply my skills somewhere outside that traditional path: librarianship. And so off I went (with a two-year hiatus in between) to graduate school for a PhD in Asian studies (Japanese literature and book history) and an MSI in Library Science at University of Michigan. Along the way, I interned at the University of Nebraska-Lincolnâs Center for Digital Research in the Humanities (CDRH), redesigning the website for, and rewriting part of the code of, a text analysis app using XSLT for the Cather archive. After Michigan, I spent a year as a postdoc at Harvardâs Resichauer Institute, working half-time on my humanities research and half-time on a digital archive (The Digital Archive of Japanâs 2011 Disasters, or JDArchive.) Then, in July 2013, I made my first big step into librarianship here at Penn, and have been happily practicing in my chosen profession since then. Iâm still new, and there is a lot to learn, but Iâm loving every minute. I admit, finding ways to integrate my CS and humanities background has been a huge challenge. I was most of the way through graduate school when someone recommended going into DH (which didnât exactly happen â there arenât a lot of non-postdoc or non-teaching jobs out there now). My dissertation project, a very close-reading-based analysis of five case studies of single books as objects and in terms of their publishing and reception, did not lend itself at all to a digital methodology other than using digital archives to get ahold of their prefaces and keyworded newspaper databases to find their advertisements and reviews. I used a citation index that goes back to the Meiji (1868-1912) period to find sources. Well, most of my research in fact involved browsing physical issues of early 20th-century magazines in the basement of a library in Japan, and looking at the books themselves in addition to the discourse surrounding them. I simply couldnât think of anything to do that would be âdigital.â So my research in that area â plus what Iâm working on now â have continued to be non-DH, although if youâre the kind of person who involves anything ânew mediaâ in the DH definition, it may be a little. (I am not that person.) Why do I still call myself a DH practitioner, and why do I bother participating in the community even now? Well, despite working full time, Iâm still committed to figuring out how to apply my skills to new, more DH-style projects, even as I donât want my other traditional humanities research to die out either. Itâs a balancing act. How to find the time and energy to learn new skills and just plain old carve out space to practice ones I already have? I have a couple of opportunities. One is my copious non-work free time. (Ha. Ha.) Second is my involvement in the open and focused lab sessions of Vitale II, the digital lab (okay, itâs a room with a whiteboard and a camera) at the Kislak Center for special collections in Van Pelt Library. I have a top-secret brainstorming session with a buddy today about how we can make even more social, mental, and temporal space for DH work in the library on a topically focused basis. Iâm jealous of the Literary Lab; that should speak for itself. In any case, I also ran into a fellow Japanese studies DH aspirant at the Association for Asian Studies Conference a few weeks ago too, and he and I are plotting with each other as well. So there are time and social connections to be made, and collaboration that can take place despite all odds. But itâs still a huge challenge. I can do my DH work at 5:30 am, in the evening (when I have no brainpower left), or early on the weekends. I have many other things competing for my time, not least two other research articles Iâm working on. I could also be doing my real work at any of those times without the need to explain. Yet I do it. Itâs because I love making things, because I love bringing my interests together and working on something that involves a different part of my brain from reading and writing. Iâm excited about the strange and wonderful things that can come from experimental analysis that, even if they arenât usable, can make me think more broadly and weirdly. More to follow. ãããããé¡ããã¾ãï¼
