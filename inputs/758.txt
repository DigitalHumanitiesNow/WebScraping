This experiment in academic public writing began with a compliment. In a Twitter conversation with @ProfessMoravec, I came across her Rationale for Academic Writing in Public in which she discusses how and why she has decided to draft her academic scholarship in public using Google Docs. I was intrigued by the model and wanted to learn more about it, so naturally, I tweeted a compliment about it to @ProfessMoravec. @cplong awww thank you how nice! — M.M. (@ProfessMoravec) January 17, 2014  @cplong yes because i use bitly when I tweet them.  Generally several hundred over the process of writing in public. — M.M. (@ProfessMoravec) January 17, 2014  @cplong yes! writing in public the whole point is to engage readers (unlike http://t.co/uL3nhRBSXe) in the process of my work.  I have 3 + — M.M. (@ProfessMoravec) January 17, 2014  @cplong projects that have been start to finish writing in public and all include footnotes to readers who helped to clarify my thoughts+ — M.M. (@ProfessMoravec) January 17, 2014  @cplong other goal for writing in public is to show no scholar actually writes alone! (sorry this is so long can you tell i LOVE the topic?) — M.M. (@ProfessMoravec) January 17, 2014  @ProfessMoravec couldnât agree more. Iâm considering adopting your strategy. Iâve been process narrating my book: http://t.co/891pxoN1g5 — Christopher Long (@cplong) January 17, 2014  While my own approach has been public, I have not exposed my work in progress at the level of drafting as @ProfessMoravec and others like @wcaleb and @tremblebot have done: @cplong Thanks! The actual "open notebook" experiment is here: http://t.co/MOwkUx9P4w — Caleb McDaniel (@wcaleb) January 17, 2014  @ProfessMoravec @cplong @wcaleb What you'll discover is I fell off when semester got going. BUT it's the only way I'll work from now on. — tremblebot (@tremblebot) January 18, 2014  So, since I am in the middle of working on an essay in honor of my former professor, Richard Bernstein, with the working title, The Ethics of Philosophy in a Digital Age, I thought I would further embody the habit of public writing by drafting the essay in public using a Google Doc accessible to the public for commenting. Drawing on Bernstein’s work on fallible pluralism and the practices of dialogue, the essay itself will focus on the practices of philosophy in a networked world. So in opening the drafting of the essay itself to a wider public network, I hope to continue to learn what it means to “do philosophy” in and with a networked public. Hannah Arendt, I imagine, would not approve. She would likely see this as one more perversion brought on by the rise of mass society. For Arendt, the emergence of the social sphere erodes the distinction between the private and the public to such a degree that idle talk and behavior supplant genuine political speech and action. These latter are possible only when we are prepared and able to speak and act in public as the unique beings we are.1 Although I have argued that Arendt herself cannot maintain a strict a dichotomy between the private and the public,2Â still, Arendt is right to worry about the reduction or even annihilation of a private space for thinking and reflection. The concerns of the social all too often overdetermine our relationships with one another, preventing us from speaking and acting in ways that disclose who we are to one another. In my own practices of scholarship, private time and space for thinking and reflection are ever diminishing commodities. I reserve them for careful reading, focused note-taking and, of course, drafting and revising. By opening my drafting and writing processes to public view and feedback, that private time and space is made more porous, but not altogether destroyed. Already with this project, I have used Scrivener to take notes on a variety of texts and consolidated some thoughts for the essay.3 So, despite Arendt’s concern about the rise of the social and the erosion of a public space of genuine speech and action, I open my work here in the hope that there is value not only in the developed articulation of the essay’s ideas, but also in the developing process by which the ideas find articulation. That process will, I hope, be enriched by the suggestions and insights of a wider public interested in the themes of the essay itself. My hope too is that the drafting process will be revealing in the sense Arendt associates with relevant public speech and action. So, continuing the experiment with public research, I invite you to view and comment as I draft this paper on with a working title: The Ethics of Philosophy in a Digital Age. Arendt, Hannah. The Human Condition. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1958, 182 ↩See, “A Fissure in the Distinction: Arendt, the Family and the Public/Private Dichotomy ↩I divide my note-taking tasks in two, using Scrivener to take reading notes directed toward a specific essay or article, and Zotero for more generic reading notes. For a broader discussion of my digital research process, take a look at this Prezi on my Digital Research Circle and my related posts on Digital Research practices. ↩
