Looking back over the last six months of so, I have spent relatively little time reading completed books that weren’t either for teaching or directly related to something I was writing, or for something like a review of a tenure dossier. Â Of course, I read lots of incompleted books: dissertations, drafts of books, books being reviewed for publication, etc. In contrast, a little over two weeks of winter break afforded me lots of time to read and so I indulged in the following texts: Michelle Murphy,Â Seizing the Means of Reproduction Jaron Lanier,Â You Are Not a GadgetÂ  John Harwood,Â The Interface: IBM and the Transformation of Corporate Design, 1945-1976 Joanna Demers,Â Listening Through the Noise: The Aesthetics of Experimental Electronic MusicÂ  N. Katherine Hayles,Â How We Think: Digital Media and Contemporary Technogenesis Melissa Gregg, Work’s Intimacy Alex Galloway,Â The Interface Effect I’m jumping around in Richard John’sÂ Network Nation but can’t say I’m done with it yet. and of course a pile of articles. In 2013, I plan to do better on the finished book front.
