Due to Googleâ€™s digitization programme, the information now available is         unprecedented: but what exactly is there, and how can it be used? The Google Ancient Places (GAP)         project investigates a means of facilitating the discovery of data that is of interest to scholars working         on the ancient world, and experiments with ways of making use of the results. This paper sets out the         work on which GAP is based, discusses our approach to finding ancient places in books, and          showcases some examples of use, in particular the visualization of places in GoogleMaps alongside         the actual text.
