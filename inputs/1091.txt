Evolution of Speechballoons -- Interesting look at how illustrators have depicted speech in various cartoons and other images over time. Part of Andy's Early Comics Archive. The site is not well-organized, but it contains lots of good stuff. Has anyone written or researched the depiction of speech, and other sounds, in medieval or early modern art and illustrations?
