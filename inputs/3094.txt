Like a lot of people, my Twitterstream blew up yesterday with the news from CERN about the possibility that neutrinos have been clocked breaking the speed of light. As a former physics major, this wigged me out, not least because it would mean that neutrino at that speed would have imaginary mass (at least according to the same Special Relativity that's at the heart of the tizzy).Tags:Â open datacollaboration
