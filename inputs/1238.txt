Gregory Crane Perseus Project and the Open Philology Project The University of Leipzig and Tufts University We are looking for help in preparing metadata for theÂ Patrologia GraecaÂ (PG) component of what we are calling theÂ Open Migne Project, an attempt to make the most useful possible transcripts of the full Patrologia Graeca and Patrologia Latina freely available. Help can consist of proofreading, additional tagging, and checking the volume/column references to the actual PG. In particular, we would welcome seeing this data converted into a dynamic index into online copies of the PG inÂ Archive.org, the HathiTrust, Google Books, or Europeana. For now, we make the working XML metadata document available on an as-is basis. More info:Â http://tinyurl.com/p39fx3f
