Spam Karma 2.0 looks like a good replacement for Kitty's Spaminator. I've been having a little trouble with Kitty's plugin, even though Sharon was kind enough to send me the latest version. Bill C.'s comment on my Memorial Day post was marked as spam, and Bill was subsequentially blacklisted by the Spaminator. Since I love Bill's comments, I had to act quickly.  The Spam Karma 2.0 admin page seems pretty sweet, though I'm not sure what half of it does yet. Hopefully it will do a better job of sorting spam from valid comments. Not that Kitty's Spaminator was bad at this. The only problem I had with it was taking someone off the blacklist, like I had to do in Bill's case.
