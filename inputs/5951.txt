 The sun came blasting at whatever time it chose to rise each morning.  But that was fine.  Hospital activity was concentrated in the morning.  Residents would come by and check on me before their surgery or whatever they did all day.  The physical therapist would make me take a walk.  I would just be happy to have made it through the night.
