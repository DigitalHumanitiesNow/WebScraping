Among its many affordances, Twitter can be a powerful public note taking tool.  At the end of a rich and exhausting conference entitled Thinking the Plural organized to celebrate the work and teaching of Richard J. Bernstein, I used Twitter to focus my attention during his final plenary keynote address on engaged fallibilistic pluralism. I share these public notes here both for my own future reference and research, and also, of course, to make them accessible to you forÂ your thoughts and comments. Perhaps so doing will afford us an opportunity to put engaged fallibilistic pluralism into practice. The lecture, which as will be seen, Bernstein characterized as a pep-talk, further expands upon Bernstein’s 1988 APA Presidential Address entitled, “Pragmatism, Pluralism and the Healing of Wounds.” That text was itself the starting point of my own attempt to articulate an Ethics of Philosophy in a Digital Age. The virtues of engaged fallibilistic pluralism are learned through practice, so perhaps this site can continue to serve as practice field. Richard J. Bernstein: Engaged Fallibilistic Pluralism Now, the main course, Dick Bernstein at #RJBPlural — Chris Long (@cplong) September 27, 2014  Mendieta evokes Heraclitus: from the many, one; one from the many in introducing Bernstein. #RJBPlural — Chris Long (@cplong) September 27, 2014  Bernstein: âYouâve all grown up to do such wonderful things.â #RJBPlural âIâve been lucky to have students like you." — Chris Long (@cplong) September 27, 2014  Bernstein: Engaged fallibilistic pluralism is seriously under threat – in the university, society, world. #RJBPlural — Chris Long (@cplong) September 27, 2014  Bernstein: âI wish for all of you that you have students like I did.â #RJBPlural — Chris Long (@cplong) September 27, 2014  Bernstein: This is going to be a pep-talk. #RJBPlural — Chris Long (@cplong) September 27, 2014  Bernstein: âFor me, philosophy was the life of the mindâ even in the mid-20th century in America. #RJBPlural — Chris Long (@cplong) September 27, 2014  Bernstein: "My one power as APA president in 1988 was to invite speakers." He invited Derrida, a thousand came. #RJBPlural — Chris Long (@cplong) September 27, 2014  Engaged Here Bernstein articulates an inclusive and open vision of engagement. This vision animates our work on the Public Philosophy Journal, and specifically our attempts to create an open peer review ecosystem that will reward community membersÂ for, as Bernstein says below, endeavoring to see the position of the other in the best possible light. Bernstein: Be Engaged: actively seek what is different; learn to listen actively to what others are saying; active imagination. #RJBPlural — Chris Long (@cplong) September 27, 2014  Bernstein: Gadamer was so important to me because he embodied what he talked about. He could listen. #RJBPlural — Chris Long (@cplong) September 27, 2014  Bernstein: Two styles of engagement: 1) agonistic, 2) dialogical. 1) focused on limits of other; 2) attempts to learn from other #RJBPlural — Chris Long (@cplong) September 27, 2014  Bernstein: Both styles have affordances and limitations. #RJBPlural — Chris Long (@cplong) September 27, 2014  Bernstein: Paul Weiss told him: you guys always want to swing the bat, but not to hit the ball. Take a critical stance. #RJBPlural — Chris Long (@cplong) September 27, 2014  Bernstein: endeavor to see the position of the other in the best possible light. #RJBPlural — Chris Long (@cplong) September 27, 2014  Fallibilism The manner in which Bernstein below embraces and emphasizes the need to be public in our fallibilism ought itself to be highlighted. In the 1988 address, he puts it this way: “For it is only by submitting our hypotheses to public critical discussion that we become aware of what is valid in our claims and what fails to withstand critical scrutiny.”1 Bernstein: Fallibilism involves a set of virtues nurtured in community; genuine willingness to test ideas in public. #RJBPlural — Chris Long (@cplong) September 27, 2014  Bernstein: Fallibilism requires a high tolerance for uncertainty. #RJBPlural — Chris Long (@cplong) September 27, 2014  Pluralism In this section, Bernstein returned to James, but he also attempted to root the idea of pluralism in the spirit of the New School itself. Horace Kallen, a founding member of the New School and the first Jew to teach at Princeton, criticized the rhetoric of the melting pot in his 1915 article in the Nation. In short, to talk of a melting pot is not to respect and welcome a plurality of perspectives, but an attempt to establish and reinforce the powerful structures of assimilation. Bernstein: A mentality in institutions all over the country give lip service to pluralism, then practices undermine it. #RJBPlural — Chris Long (@cplong) September 27, 2014  Here is the Wikipedia link to Cartesian Anxiety: http://t.co/atHddYsVlX #RJBPlural — Chris Long (@cplong) September 27, 2014  Bernstein: Craving for absolutes is destructive. No absolutes, but always better and worse reasons. #RJBPlural — Chris Long (@cplong) September 27, 2014  Bernstein: Be passionate and committed, but be also a fallibilist. #RJBPlural — Chris Long (@cplong) September 27, 2014  Bernstein: Pluralism – William James first to use it in a title of a book: Pluralistic Universe #RJBPlural — Chris Long (@cplong) September 27, 2014  Bernstein: James there is no place outside the world to see the world sub specie aeternitatis #RJBPlural — Chris Long (@cplong) September 27, 2014  Bernstein: With hard work, imagination, we can understand different points of view – pluralism. #RJBPlural — Chris Long (@cplong) September 27, 2014  Bernstein: Philosophical issues are never just philosophical issues, theyâre connected always to everyday life. #RJBPlural — Chris Long (@cplong) September 27, 2014  Bernstein: Rhetoric of melting pot meant assimilation. Horace Kallen  @TheNewSchool fought it. http://t.co/89f8jocOdd #RJBPlural — Chris Long (@cplong) September 27, 2014  Bernstein has been participating in the Istanbul seminars: http://t.co/2B3PqRMspj #RJBPlural — Chris Long (@cplong) September 27, 2014  Bernstein: Weiss âKeep in view the ideals that brought you to the life of the mind." #RJBPlural — Chris Long (@cplong) September 27, 2014  Bernstein: To a frightening extent, money rules in the university. Quotes Dewey on the corporate mindset. #RJBPlural — Chris Long (@cplong) September 27, 2014  Bernstein: Itâs easy to become cynical, but donât. Try to figure out new ways to facilitate the ideals you value. #RJBPlural — Chris Long (@cplong) September 27, 2014  .@ScottTimcke Thanks for listening. Sometimes live-tweeting is an act of faith. #RJBPlural — Chris Long (@cplong) September 28, 2014  Bernstein, Richard J. âPragmatism, Pluralism and the Healing of Wounds.â Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association 63, no. 3 (November 1, 1989): 5â18. doi:10.2307/3130079. ↩
