The Humanities Networked Infrastructure (HuNI) is a national Virtual Laboratory project developed as part of the Australian governmentâs NeCTAR (National e-Research Collaboration Tools and Resources) program. HuNI combines information from 30 of Australiaâs most significant cultural datasets. These datasets comprise more than 2 million authoritative records relating to the people, organisations, objects and events that make up Australia's rich cultural heritage. HuNI also enables researchers to work with and share this large-scale aggregation of cultural information. HuNI has been developed as a partnership between 13 public institutions, led by Deakin University. By providing researchers worldwide with access to the combined resources of Australiaâs most important cultural datasets and information assets, HuNI is recognised as the first national, cross-disciplinary virtual laboratory of its kind to be established anywhere in the world.
