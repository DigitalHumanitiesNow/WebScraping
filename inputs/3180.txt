Over at Jacket2, my weekly commentary describes the work of Margaret Rhee, a feminist new media artist and scholar: Kimchi, a Korean side dish of fermented vegetables and spices, is perhaps best known as a polarizing condiment, engendering love, hatred, and YouTube videos of screaming children trying it for the first time. It is also serves as inspiration for the work of Margaret Rhee, a feminist new media artist and scholar. In The Kimchi Poetry Project, she asks, “What feminist methods, histories, and stories can we unearth and create through the poetics of kimchi?” (Rhee, “Installation – The Kimchi Poetry Project”). Rhee’s innovative work explores the possibilities at the intersections of kimchi, tweets, and poetry. Read more at http://jacket2.org/commentary/tweets-poems-and-kimchi.
