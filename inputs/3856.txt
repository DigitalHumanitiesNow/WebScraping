 	Knight Foundation launched the Tech for Engagement initiative in 2010 to experiment with new civic technologies and tools that spur citizen engagement, improve cities and make government more effective. Knight has invested over $25 million in nearly fifty projects since that time, ranging from neighborhood forums like Front Porch Forum, to civic crowdfunding platforms like neighbor.ly, to efforts that promote government innovation like Code for America.
