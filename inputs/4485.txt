Since I’m apparently in self-promotion mode … This past weekend, I gave a talk in the Notre Dame College of Arts and Letters’ Saturday Scholars series. These are public lectures aimed at curious folks who are in town for football games. It was a lot of fun and, apart from spilling water on my laptop because I’m a doofus and a klutz, I think it went well. Video is embedded below; there was also a write-up in the student newspaper.
