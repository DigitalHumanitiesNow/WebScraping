Text mining is making its way into the Humanities.         I expect that in         the age of large corpora, mining tools will soon have a place on the         scholar's workbench next to the established concordancing tools, but         this is not the case yet. In the Classics, as far as I am aware,         nothing has been published in this area so far. Yet some of the         field's notorious Big Questions To Be Avoided (the relative chronology         of early epic poetry; authorship in Lysias or the Hippocratic corpus;         women's language; ..) would seem to lend themselves to experiments in         text mining. Will such experiments offer literary scholars results         they actually consider interesting or meaningful? Are we perhaps         better off studying documentary corpora or scientific texts? In my         paper I will apply the open-source mining software Philomine developed         at the University of Chicago to the Perseus Greek texts and discuss         some of these Big Questions and possible future avenues.
