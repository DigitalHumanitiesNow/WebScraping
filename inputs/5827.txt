I can see I’m going to have to up my game. Since my last post, I’ve had a small bevy of media appearances, which I have dutifully Tweeted and Facebooked, but between travel and too many deadlines, I’ve not posted them here. Â I can now see the advantage of that whole Tumblr integrate your online universe thing. So, some catch-up of where else I’ve been on the internet this month: Slate Review Pitchfork Interview (and Wall Street Journal blog post) Times Higher Education Supplement Review Times Higher Education Supplement opinion piece on the Quebec student movement, co-authoed with Lilian Radovac FACT Magazine Interview and, in case you’re in town: Montreal Book Launch: 12 September 12, 19.00-21.0-0 at Librairie Drawn & Quarterly I hope I didn’t miss anything. More news here as it happens.
