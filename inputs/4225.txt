[Note: This post is part two of a three-part series about digital annotation, The Problems with Genius. Part One is here.]Is it possible to annotate literature in a digital environment? Certainly, the answer is "yes." Is it possible to do so well and in a way that respects the ambiguity, complexity, and polyvocality of both the texts and the readersâ responses? If the annotations are, like a Wikipedia article, a single text composed through consensus, then I argue in this post that the answer is almost certainly "no." Yet, this model is the one that Genius wants to impose upon literature, as it expands beyond rap lyrics into several other realms. As another signal of their grand ambitions, the companyâs founders have compared Genius to a digital Talmud, but the Talmud, like other rich traditions of exegesis, is not a single narrative. Instead, it is divided into multiple sections discussing different aspects of the Torah and includes explanations, interpretations, and practical applications written by a large number of rabbis throughout history. Moreover, the original "annotations" have in turn been annotated (Mishnah and Gemara, respectively). Far from a series of univocal, authoritative explanatory notes, the Talmud thus comprises a complicated, structured, and rich history of commentary.Education GeniusEven though we cannot expect Genius to compete with this tradition (and should take proclamations that Genius is the "Internetâs Talmud" as hyperbolic promotional copy), the decision to simplify every annotation down to a single, authoritative comment does a disservice to the works at hand, whether they are rap lyrics, poetry, or news articles. Nevertheless, Geniusâs leaders want to prove that the platform is useful for all these topics, including as a tool for learning and teaching in the classroom. To this end, theyâve developed a series of resources for educators and special guidelines for the annotation of literature, which they call "Lit Genius." Related to "Lit Genius" is "Education Genius," which, rather than a topical focus, is aimed at providing tools for instructors who might wish to use Genius in the classroom. There are several ways in which Education Genius differs from the other affordances of the site as a whole. First, it is possible for instructors to have their account promoted to the "Educator" status, which enables some new functionality:accepting and sending feedback on student annotationscreating private "class pages"annotating class pages with verified "Educator" annotationsaccess to the Educatorâs Forum to interact with other educators, get updates on new features, ask questions, etc.The first feature, the ability to send feedback on studentsâ annotations, sounds good, but in practice, it actually puts the instructor in the role filled by Genius editors: gatekeeper. In this scenario, the instructor is the person who allows students to see each otherâs annotations and who combines suggestions from the class into a coherent, single annotation of a passage. Until an annotation is "accepted," it will be marked in red. Once accepted, it is no longer editable by the student who created it.This role also allows instructors to have their annotations marked as by a "Verified Educator" that "cannot be edited and will be distinct from student annotations." So, rather than an exploration of a work in which instructor and student collaborate on meaning-making, Education Genius maintains a hierarchical divide between teacher and learner. This divide is a traditional pedagogical style and may be one that some educators find appropriate and useful, though itâs not my style of teaching: I prefer to facilitate discussion, not to lecture. Rather than allowing the instructor to adapt Education Genius to her goals for the class, however, the platform enforces this specific dynamic.The next affordance, the ability to create private class pages, is a nod to student privacy and to the necessity of using a "clean" text in the classroom, rather than one with existing annotations. It allows instructors to create copies of existing works on the site in a semi-private space or to upload new texts. Although Genius prefers that all annotations be public, they do allow for this use, which also lets instructors bypass Geniusâs usual guidelines for annotations (e.g., forbidding annotations that use the first person). This greater degree of privacy and freedom is crucial for pedagogical uses of annotation.Still, the platform faces another challenge that bedevils all digital copies of texts: copyright. Instructors cannot put entire texts that are under copyright on the site. Instead, they can only use excerpts that meet Fair Use requirements. Rather than a platform for reading a novel, Education Genius would be a more appropriate choice for an instructor to upload an excerpt for closer analysis or clarification by students. Again, this limitation is not necessarily a problem per se, but it is something anyone considering adopting Genius in the classroom must consider.The entire site is, further, not designed as a reading environment where one can experiment with interpretations or take notes while reading, but as an explanatory resource somewhat akin to Cliffâs Notes, where students might go to annotate only after having read. While Genius is making an effort to reach out to educators and adapt the platform in some limited ways for use in the classroom, I donât think itâs nearly enough to make it something I would rely on for teaching.Lit Genius and T.S. Eliot's "The Wasteland"Because many instructors who want students to annotate are also teaching literature and because I am skeptical of Geniusâs foray into the annotation of literature, I now turn to some concrete examples from the Lit Genius section of the site. Reeves Wiedeman notes that Lit Geniusâs main challenge, "similar to the one faced in Wikipediaâs early days, is convincing people that the content it produces is useful and reliable. Lit Genius now has more than 100,000 texts, of which the gold standard is its version of âThe Waste Land,â on which 93 different people have appended 317 annotations."Letâs consider, then, the Genius annotated version of this poem. The annotations are often detailed and replete with information like what one might get from a Norton Critical Edition of the poem, but mixed with this information are odd value judgments and pop culture references. Moreover, the tone (a mix of faux objectivity and professorial authority) and content both imply that the annotations provide the "right" way to read the poem, rather than one, potentially contested interpretation. Instead, interpretations are regularly stated as fact and without backing.The annotation of the opening line notes the allusion to Chaucerâs "General Prologue" to the Canterbury Tales, but also contains odd interpretive moments such as this:The cruelty in April lies not only in its showers (raining all the time!) but also in its generative capacity: the living dead in the Waste Land donât like to be reminded of hope, life, sensuality, etc.And:Eliot chops and screws the Chaucer quote, setting a dark, elegiac tone that persists throughout the poem.Surely the claim of a "dark, elegiac tone" is an argument that demands sustained analysis; here, it is stated as fact. Were one of my students to make such a claim, I would demand evidence from throughout the poem to back it up.Similarly, a later paragraph in the annotation reads:The claim that "April is the cruelest [sic] month" also proffers an irony: that a month associated with life, with Easter, with rebirth, with flowers, etc. is cruel rather than kind, should shock the reader. Winter is warm; spring is cold, cruel, awful. The opening line then is cruel as well, turning against several commonplaces. If life is cruel, if awakening is cruel, if breeding is cruel, then death, letting the dead stay dead, would be the only kindness.Much of the annotation reads like a research essay from an undergraduate literature course. The annotation proffers interpretation without much evidence or other forms of persuasion, but with a tone of great certainty about its validity. (Iâm also inordinately bothered by the conversion of Eliotâs British spelling "cruellest" into "cruelest" when quoted in the annotation, hence my "sic.") Instead of nuanced interpretation that indicates the richness and ambiguity of these lines, we find explanation that aims to resolve complexity like it were a puzzle to be solved.Then there are the zombies.Iâm certainly not against injecting humor or pop culture into literary analysis. Moreover, creating multimedia annotations is one of the key digital literacies Genius and other digital annotation platforms promote. Even the idea of making connections between a serious poem (Eliot was nothing if not Very Serious) and zombies delights me. Generating connections among artifacts is one of the key learning outcomes promoted by my own Lacuna Stories, even. But it seems, if nothing else, jarring to mix exegesis of allusions to medieval literature, random exclamation marks more at home in text messages, and unexpected images of zombies.I thought, at first, that the uneven quality of these annotations might be because poetry isnât the first focus of Genius, but a look over some of the most popular annotated rap lyrics suggests that most annotations have somewhere between one to six contributors. The passages under question for Eliotâs poem are no different. Wiedeman writes: "In grasping for an analogy to encompass their ambition, the Genius founders have variously described the project as a âwall of historyâ and an âinternet Talmud.â Critics, who consider the majority of its annotations sophomoric at best, have called it an âinternet decoder ring.â" For the "gold standard" of literary annotations, the work on Eliotâs masterpiece does remain remarkably sophomoric. It represents an attempt to decode and simplify rather than to explore and abide with complexity in a generative way.Annotation as InterpretationPerhaps annotations with a longer history and more contributors will be better. We can compare the annotation by some of the Genius co-founders of a Jay-Z verse in the Drake song "Light Up." The verse reads: "Oww, hoes turn they heads like owls, Iâm the man of the hour / Triple entendre, donât even ask me how." The annotation has had eighteen contributors whose edits range from four years ago to as recently as a month ago, so we might expect the annotation to be of a particularly high quality. The explanation revolves around the definition of a triple-entendre and whether Jay-Zâs lines qualify as such, which the crowd has answered "no," "each interpretation essentially boils down to âgirls turn their heads to look at Jay because he is the man.â" Note the emphasis on the nature of meaning and the factuality of Jay-Zâs claim. Thereâs not a word said about the comparison of women to animals, the denigrating language, prosody, or a whole host of other possible avenues to pursue.Thereâs also a GIF of an owl that, typical of Genius, imbues the annotation with a light-hearted, meme-like quality (giving me fears of the "weâre just having fun!" defense so commonly found on the Internet). Granted, a detailed exegesis of every rap lyric that takes into account misogyny and other issues would be exhausting and quickly repetitive (I write this as a dedicated, life-long rap fan, by the way), but itâs another example of how the reliance on a single narrative combines with the ethos of the site to focus on only particular aspects of a line and how that commentary remains primarily at the level of explication, mixed with authoritative-seeming interpretation. An inexperienced reader, in fact, could easily miss the distinction between interpretation and explanation.Why, beyond my basic objection to the idea that there should be a single, collaboratively-authored interpretation of lines of literature, does the quality matter? After all, Tom Lehman, the CEO of Genius, regularly remixes the Silicon Valley mantra to "fail faster" as "worse is better," which leads to situations where "Ezra Pound is listed as the producer of the poem âThe Waste Land.â The Great Gatsby appears as an album, and the Gettysburg Address is broken down into lyrics." Iâm an advocate of trying new things, seeing what fails, and learning from those mistakes (though listing Ezra Pound as the producer of Eliotâs "song" irks the literature scholar in me), but as an educational tool, the lack of attention to detail seems like a poor model for students. If we as educators encourage our students to contribute their time and efforts to improving the annotations on a site that cannot bother to properly cite literary works, how can we then expect them to produce writing that maintains a far higher degree of carefulness and precision?It seems likely that given Geniusâs conscious modeling after Wikipedia and thus its reliance on a single narrative, that its annotations will often appear to be explanation and rephrasing rather than participatory interpretation.1 Here, again, another key difference between the Genius guidelines and Wikipediaâs arises. One of the pillars of Wikipedia, related to "verifiability, not truth" is "no original research." Genius, on the other hand, encourages interpretation (i.e., original research) without limit or clear indications to separate novel readings from contextualizing annotations. When interpretation happens, therefore, it might easily evince the same biases that bedevil other internet communities, with their implicit white supremacist, misogynist, and heteronormative perspectives, but without any markers for the reader that indicate when explanation shades into interpretation.ConclusionAlthough Education Genius rightly identifies public writing as a digital literacy with which students and instructors could and possibly should engage, a critical stance towards this twenty-first century literacy is also needed.2 Unlike Wikipedia, which draws on the long intellectual tradition of encyclopedias, Genius abandons the affordances and purposes of annotation as historically understood (i.e., private or semi-public, interpretative, dialogic) by grafting the encyclopediaâs conceptual model onto the annotation space.There is, thus, an inherent tension between the need to create a safe space for private and/or collaborative interpretive work and the public display of student work as contributions to a single, master narrative.3 Despite the mimicry of Wikipediaâs model for annotations, which, again, is at odds with the long tradition of textual commentary, Genius is not a non-profit organization like the Wikimedia Foundation. Education Genius has been grafted on to an existing platform, one not designed for teaching and learning. At best, itâs useful as a funâif problematicâintroduction to annotation.What, then, are potential alternatives that might allow students to explore multiple interpretations, clearly mark subjective readings, or use annotations as a personal thinking space while working through a text? These are some of the questions I will explore in my next post, The Problems with Genius, Part Three: Research and Connected Learning through Lacuna Stories.Notes1 Itâs useful to consider a taxonomy of the types of annotations users might create and for what purposes, as Matthias Bauer and Angelika Zirker have done. They divide annotations into five categories: linguistic, formal, intratextual, intertextual, contextual, and interpretative. From my exploration of Genius, it appears that most annotations are contextual and interpretative (it is hard to disentangle the two on the site) with a smattering of intertextual, as well.2 It also raises serious concerns about FERPA compliance when used in an educational setting.3 While the value inheres in the explicatory quality of the annotations and thus also doubles as a potentially useful resource (which is, at best, a starting point for entrÃ©e into a text), a critical approach towards public writing must also acknowledge this free labor on the part of a privately-owned corporation. As Siva Vaidhyanathan writes in his discussion of the Crypopticon (his contemporization of the Panopticon), "[t]he race to monitor, monetize, and manipulate the attention given by users in exchange for 'free' services marks the current corporate moment. It also characterizes the mania that drives companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple to create more than the operating system of our computers or phones. They are racing to become the operating system of our lives." Genius follows in this path by seeking, eventually, to monetize the attention and efforts of its "geniuses." The encouragement of public annotation is a way to harness what Clay Shirky calls the "cognitive surplus" of Geniusâs users to steadily improve the value of the product. A responsible pedagogue will also make this lesson part of the digital literacies she establishes as a learning goal for students, while (I hope) questioning if it is responsible to use student work as a way to improve a privately-owned productâs value.
