by Beth  This year, the Istanbul Design Biennial has chosen the theme The Future is Not What it Used To Be. When they opened the call for participation back in January, they asked for manifestos of any form â words, videos, artworks, anything that spoke to this theme. So the Mapmaker Manifesto was born. This manifesto demands that we look at the data around us in an honest and critical way. With this information, we may choose a direction towards our future and find a healthy, sustainable way to get there.     It all starts with determining a collective you are here â but what is that? Is it cohesive? Disjointed? Funny? Sad? The works we have selected, put together, begin to paint a picture of the very tip of this iceberg. The content ranges from meditative walks to informal bus systems, with media from paper and paint to vectors and video. It's messy. It's overwhelming. And it's absolutely beautiful.  Without further ado, Stamen is pleased to announce the artists and works weâve selected for the Mapmaker Manifesto curation.

We are delighted to work with all of you and look forward to showing your maps in Istanbul from Nov. 1 â Dec. 14. Many thanks also to all the artists and designers who sent in their maps. It has been a joy to go through all of them, and a challenge to choose the above list.  Onwards to Istanbul!   Learn more about the 2014 Istanbul Design Biennial!
