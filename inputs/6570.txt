This week we honor Delaware Soldiers James Leo Harkins, Holton Atkinson Vance, and Charles B. Thompson. Â On the warfront, Germany drives to the North Sea, Warships avoid the Panama Canal, and Switzerland stubbornly maintains neutrality.                      For more soldiers from Delaware and Sunday Star clips, see past posts of Remembering WWI in Delaware Â https://dhsbookswwi.wordpress.com
