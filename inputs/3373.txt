Imageplot of 50,000 Instagram images from Paris (spring 2013) organized by average brightness and contrast.The new paper by Nadav Hochman (see Phototrails project) has been published in BIG DATA and SOCIETY:The Social Media ImageDownload full paper textAbstract:How do the organization and presentation of large-scale social mediaimage sets in social networking apps affect the creation of visualknowledge, value, and meaning?The article analyzes fundamental elements in the changing syntax ofexisting visual software ontology â the ways current social mediaplatforms and aggregators present and categorize social media images.It shows how visual media created within social media platformsfollow distinct modes of knowledge production and acquisition.First, I analyze the structure of social media images within data streams asopposed to previous information organization in structured databases.While the database has no pre-defined notions of time and thuschallenges traditional linear forms, the data stream re-emphasizes thelinearity of a particular data sequence and activates a set of newrelations to contemporary temporalities.Next, I show how these visual arrangements and temporal principles aremanifested and discussed in three artworks: Untitled (PerfectLovers) by Felix Gonzalez-Torres (1991), The Clock byChristian Marclay (2011), and Last Clock by Jussi ÃngeslevÃ¤ andRoss Cooper (2002).By emphasizing the technical and poetic ways in which social mediasituate the present as a âthickâ historical unit that embodiesmultiple and synchronous temporalities, the article illuminates someof the conditions, challenges, and tensions between former visualstructures and current ones, and unfolds the cultural significationsof contemporary big visual data.software studies initiative
