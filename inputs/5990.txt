My first semester as a professor was the fall of 1999.  What I remember the most was the intensity.  It was like a constant sprint except I didn’t always know where or why I was running.  Then, sometime in October a Friday afternoon arrived when there wasn’t something I urgently had to do.  I had a choice of what to do with my time.  Exhausted from weeks of sensory overload, I went to sleep. Just under 30 minutes ago, the clock rolled over to midnight eastern time.  I am now officially on sabbatical for the first time after 11 years of a mad dash.  And I’m celebrating by going to sleep.   A full report on the trip and the new digs will be forthcoming.
