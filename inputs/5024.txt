Bina Venkataraman was White House adviser on climate change innovation and is now at the Broad Foundation Institute working on long-term vs. short-term issues. She has a good op-ed piece in Sunday's Boston Globe entitled The race to preserve disappearing data. She and I e-mailed to and fro as she worked on the op-ed, and I'm quoted in it.Update: Bina's affiliation corrected - my bad.
