OpenEdition is pleased to announce the arrival ofÂ German publisher C.H.Beck on OpenEdition Books, the digital platform for open access academic publishing. C.H.Beck collections will be available on OpenEdition Books in April 2014. The C.H.Beck catalogue on OpenEdition will initially include around 30 books drawn from its classical studies series (Zetemata: Monographien zur klassischen Altertumswissenschaft) and papyrus studies series (MÃ¼nchener BeitrÃ¤ge zur Papyrusforschung und antiken Rechtsgeschichte). Two-thirds of the books will come from the classical studies series, which examines topics such as philology, history, epistemology and theology in the works of writers and philosophers of Ancient Greece and Rome. The papyrus studies series contributes to scholarship on the law, politics, economy and administration of ancient civilisations, notably the Ptolemaic and Hellenistic periods. Most of the books will be available in Open Access Freemium: free HTML, with PDF, ePub and eReader formats available exclusively to subscribing institutions and through digital bookstores.
