By Robert Wilks Museo NacionÃ¡l de AntropologÃ­a, Mexico. Via Wikipedia. My favorite history museum, and one of my favorite museums of any type, is the Museo NacionÃ¡l de AntropologÃ­a in Mexico City. It is housed in an enormous structure filled with the pre-Columbian culture of Mexico. It covers every civilization, period and style in its artifacts. They are beautifully displayed, perfectly lit and present a dazzling array of forms and colors. There is so much to see, multiple visits are required. I was totally amazed at the richness and variety of cultures. I highly recommend it. Monolith of the Stone of the Sun, also named Aztec calendar stone.
