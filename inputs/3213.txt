Thacker begins In the Dust of this Planet with the words, "The world is increasingly unthinkable," and I'm caught by the very first three letters, "t," "h," and "e," particularly his choice to use the word "the" and not "a" as a first encounter with the premise for his book.  This distinction between the world and a world is explored subtly throughout the rest of this prologue, but it's his choice here, at the very opening, that fascinates me.  A world is an indeterminate place, one particular but undefined locale amongst many possible locales, an oasis of sand in a much larger desert of sand.  The world is an altogether more determined and definite sort of place, one locale amongst a dearth of other possible locales, just sand, a lone puddle.
