 At the Hospitality Technology’sÂ Hotel Technology ForumÂ inÂ Puerto Rico.Â April 22, 2015 there will be a talk about applying social media network analysis to better understand how guests talk about hotels in social media. The guest experience is often reflected in theÂ social media they create while on the property and after. Some social media can help elevate a brand and provide insights and new ways to deliver services. Some social media can amplify service problems and erode a brand. Social media network maps and reports can help businesses navigate the complex landscape of social media, identifying the key people, groups and topics in the discussions that are relevant to the business. In this talk we will review the ways NodeXL can be used to generate maps and reports that can guide a social media engagement strategy.
