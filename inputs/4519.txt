Today we’re delighted to share a message received from Tom Dwyer, Editor-in-Chief of the University of Michigan Press, who reports that their executive committee has approved publication of Writing History in the Digital AgeÂ for theÂ Digital Humanities Series of itsÂ digitalculturebooksÂ imprint. The contents of our born-digital, peer-reviewed, open-access volume is currently available online, and we anticipate that the Press will produce a copyedited version for print and digital publication soon. We’ll share more details as we receive them. Earlier today, we spoke with Korey Jackson (formerly at the University of Michigan Press, now with Anvil Academic) who conducted a web video interview with us to learn more about our editorial process and to celebrate Open Access Week. Since Anvil Academic is a Creative Commons site, we’re able to easily share the entire content with you below: Anvil Interviews â A Conversation with Jack Dougherty & Kristen Nawrotzki, by Korey Jackson, October 22, 2012  As a way of celebrating Open Access Week, we kick off the first of our Anvil Interviewsâa series of conversations with prominent scholars in digital humanities and open access publishing. In this first interview, Anvil Program Coordinator Korey Jackson talks to Jack Dougherty (Associate Professor of Education Studies at Trinity College, Hartford, CT) and Kristen Nawrotzki (Lecturer in English at the University of Education in Heidelberg, Germany). They are co-editors of Writing History in the Digital Age, an open access and openly reviewed collection under contract with the University of Michigan Press. The collection is, in the words of its editors, all about the ways âthe digital revolution transformed how we write about the past.â Our talk is broken up into three parts. In part one we discuss the origin history of Writing History. Jack and Kristen also talk about how and why they decided to make the collection available as an open access publication and as a test case for open, public peer review. In part 2, we get under the hood of the CommentPress platform used to host both the original content and the review comments. We also touch on some the benefits (and challenges) of this endeavor into post-publication reviewing. Part 3 concludes with a turning of the tables. In the spirit of openness and transparency, Jack and Kristen ask Korey some questions about how Anvil will meet the needs of digital scholars, and how its particular open access ethics will form the backdrop for future publications.
