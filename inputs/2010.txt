The Medieval Electronic Scholarly Alliance (MESA) is an international community of scholars, projects, institutions, and organizations engaged in digital scholarship within the field of medieval studies. Funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, MESA makes recommendations on technological and scholarly standards for electronic scholarship, aggregates data from digital projects, and provides an interface for scholars to discover and repurpose this data. The seminar will focus on how MESA serves the “traditional” medievalist who is interested in finding and using digital resources. Starting with a history of medievalists and their interactions with digital technology, the seminar will finish with a demonstration of MESA.
