I was talking to a design team yesterday and one of the team members casually mentioned that they were launching something new. I took a quick look at what they were planning to launch and it was clear that something wasnât quite right…there was a weird UI bug and some data looked off. So I pointed those things out and was told “Oh yeah, we know. Weâre going to fix it later”.  Those words, so subtle. I’ve said them many times. Iâve had the exact same attitude at a release. But the more I hear them the more I realize theyâre deadly. Consider the negative effects they have:  Your customers get a lower quality product. You know it and they know it, and so what are their expectations going forward? Theyâre going to be lower, and thatâs a slippery slope you donât want to start down. Release quality sets expectations. Almost as importantly you send the wrong signal to the product team. By putting out less than your very best product, youâre saying itâs OK to do less than your best work. This is poisonous. You might not see the effects in the short-term but the long-term effects of this sentiment cannot be understated. In effect youâre creating a culture where itâs OK to do mediocre work. Youâre accruing product debt. No product team that I know of gets done a release and doesnât have a whole list of things to work on next. There is always at least a backlog of next features to work on so itâs never as simple as fixing the things you couldnât before release. And many, many times the small things that were released with the promise of being âfixed laterâ donât actually get addressed at allâ¦some issues never get fixed!  Iâm a big believer in the power of words and the words âweâll fix it laterâ, while seemingly innocuous, are actually preventing you from releasing the very best product you can. So the next time you hear them push back hard and realize that if there is something worth fixing itâs always better to fix it before release rather than after. The real signal that youâre following this idea is when you actually delay a release because your product is not the best it can be for your customers.
