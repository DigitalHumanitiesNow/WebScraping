Beyond the potential Angela Sutton cites for using football as a lens  to better understand South Africa (and its history), the World Cup also  offers educators an opportunity to teach history through the match-ups  found between the 32 teams. The championship game pits the Netherlands  and Spain-two countries with a long and intertwined history. Likewise,  previous games were also fraught with interesting sub-plots: Portugal  and its former colony of Brazil, England and the United States, France  and Mexico (think Cinco de Mayo), Spain and its former colonies of  Honduras and Chileâ¦and thatâs just the first round games! If we were to re-visit past World Cup classics, like  Argentina-England in 1986, we can quickly use the tensions behind the  games to better understand the political history involved, as well as  the sporting history countries often share. In this case, England  introduced football to Argentina in the 1880s and the two nations shared  an often contentious sporting relationship leading up to the  Falkland/Malvinas War of 1982 and the now-classic Quarterfinal match-up  four years later. The story is fascinating, and strong enough that it forms a part of  my own historical research. For students, the World Cup offers an  opportunity to make history come alive in the classroom and provide  authentic and real engagement with the curriculum. Even if South Africa,  or the continent at large, is not part of your curriculum, the  international diversity of the participating teams provides educators  with plenty of fodder. Lastly, the World Cup is also an excellent bridge  to modern issues such as globalization, tribalization, national  identity, regional differences, gender in marketing, and religious  tensions. Thanks to Angela for this timely blog posting.
