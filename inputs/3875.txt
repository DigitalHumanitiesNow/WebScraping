   <p>In my experience, students arenât <a href="https://www.improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume5/v5i6/GrandmotherEffect%205-6.pdf">more likely to have a personal/family tragedy right before an exam</a>. Theyâre more likely to <em>tell me about it</em> when there is a major or high-stakes project due soon. In other words, maybe they want to keep it private â which is totally within their rights â but the disproportionate power that grades and high-stakes tests hold over their future donât allow it. When the choice to keep private matters private comes with a grade penalty, grades usually win. And thatâs a pretty awful state.</p>  <p>Hopefully the fallout of these âDear Studentâ pieces on Vitae and the criticism that they have spawned (largely thanks to Jesse Stommel) will lead us educators to think more carefully about what high-stakes work we put in front of our students. Yes, education should help students learn to deal with pressure â but thatâs not a reason for every assignment to come with major penalties for missing it, or for every topic of study to end with a major closed-book test. Yes, students should learn how to put together major work (papers, performances, apps, websites, etc.) and to work collaboratively, but that doesnât mean that every week needs to bring another major at-home group project. Letâs be strategic about these things. And letâs exercise generosity on the front end when we make those assignment decisions â and if possible let students have some part in making them â so that less students feel they need to share all of their private tragedies with their teachers in order to stay afloat academically.</p>    <p><a href="http://kris.shaffermusic.com/2015/03/tragedy-and-generosity/">Tragedy and generosity</a> was originally published by Kris Shaffer at <a href="http://kris.shaffermusic.com">Kris Shaffer</a> on March 04, 2015.</p>
