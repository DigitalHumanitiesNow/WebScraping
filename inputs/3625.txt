 Are screenshorts slowly killing blogging as we know it? For some things, I think so, because itâs an easier and more authentic way to reach your fans, friends or followers directly on social media than it is to spend time setting up a blog and then sharing out the link. Sharing text as an image has other benefits too: it helps increase shareability on social media because we respond better to visuals versus text. A test by Buffer found that it leads to 150 percent more retweets than a tweet without an image. If thatâs true, itâs no wonder everyoneâs blogging as an image. —The Next Web.
