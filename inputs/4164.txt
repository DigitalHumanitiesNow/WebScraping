 by Elizabeth GoinsPox and the City is an NEH funded project dreamed up by Lisa Rosner. Rosner, together with Ethan Watrall and Laura Zucconi created the initial concept. It was then up to me, the project lead at RIT, to design and build the thing. We had a shoestring budget, 20 weeks for game design and development, and a few guidelines: had to be in Flash, had to be an RPG, had to be set in ca 1800 Edinburgh, had to be about the social history of the smallpox vaccine and the developing medical profession.Before we could really dig in to design, we had to tackle the research. One of the issues we faced early on was that of working with our content expert, Lisa Rosner, remotely. We built the game in Rochester, NY but Lisa was in New Jersey. Communication between interdisciplinary team members is a big issue in the development of many humanities games. Two camps form: the game designers and developers who know next to nothing about the content vs the content experts. In a  commercial game, this isn't such a problem as the focus is on entertainment. However, in an educational humanities game, the content is absolutely critical and designers really do have to listen to the content experts. The content experts, on the other hand, often know so little about games that they don't  understand what type of information the design team needs. We had no choice but to address this problem by carrying out our own research as our expert was far away. We also enlisted the help of a professor in the English department who worked with 19th century medical texts, Lisa Hermsen, to liaise with Lisa Rosner. This really helped a lot in the initial design phase. Lisa Hermsen met with Lisa Rosner and was able to represent her locally. She was also able to fact check and make sure we got our history straight. Lisa Hermsen also bought books. Lots and lots of books! We spent the summer reading everything we could get our hands  on. We read Lisa Rosner's dissertation, Edward Jenner's experiments and countless other primary and secondary source materials. Then, we could read no longer,  we had to actually start.The project was dived into two stages. The first stage was ten weeks of designing and prototyping. I was really lucky to find an undergraduate game designer who also had a strong humanities background, Jason Ferreira, who would act as lead designer. I served as project lead (aka producer or PI) which meant that I worked on everything. Jason carried the lion's share of the design work. He created paper prototype minigames, a prototype narrative game engine in Visionaire and a hefty design document. All the while, we constantly received feedback on historic content from both Lisa Hermsen and Lisa Rosner. During this initial phase, we found a lead artist, Jon Dymock, also an RIT undergraduate student. Now, even though we had  a very small budget to start with, I must confess that most of it went to design and development. There was a small fraction left for the art. This was a huge challenge because we had an RPG with lots of characters and locations. I'd really like to stop here for a moment to give a small piece of advice: Don't underestimate the art!  The artists create the world for you...AND build all the user interfaces and every asset in the game. It is a huge amount of work and, seriously, your game needs a good art team.Main Lessons Learned:1.) Imperative to find a way to get lots of input from the content expert, fill in with your own research but always check back with your primary content expert (or client) to make sure you're on target. Really listen to them!2.) Prototype from day 1. Show it to the content expert. You may have to educate them a little as they won't see the whole process in their mind like you do, or understand that you are JUST looking at mechanics now or whatever. So, in short, communicate. You will have to walk a fine line between listening to content expert feedback and guiding them on good game design principles.3.) The art team needs a lot of money.4.) Don't forget sound. They need money, too.Play Pox and the City!
