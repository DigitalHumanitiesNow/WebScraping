The NINES office was just sent the following press release about Transcribe Minutes, an exciting crowdsourcing initiative out of the University of Delaware. The initiative focuses on crowdsourcing efforts to transcribe entries on TheÂ Colored Conventions Project, an exciting project that aims to make more widely available records from the nineteenth-century African American convention movement. BeÂ sure to take part after you read more below! The Colored Conventions Project Launches a Crowdsourcing Initiative The Colored Conventions Project at the University of Delaware is delighted to announce the launch of a crowdsourcing project,Â Transcribe Minutes. This initiative invites people to visitÂ ColoredConventions.orgÂ to transcribe records of the nineteenth-century African American convention movement. The first batch of available documents includes some of the most exciting conventions, featuring well-known leaders such as Frederick Douglass and Henry Highland Garnet from the 1840s with other batches to follow in 2015. The movement began in 1830 in response to the violence and expulsion faced by Blacks in the âfreeâ states. First held at Philadelphiaâs Bethel A.M.E. Church, conventions soon spread across North America. âAfrican American leaders and lay people organized for decades to fight against educational inequities, voting and political disenfranchisement as well as job and labor discrimination,â says P. Gabrielle Foreman, faculty director of the Colored Conventions Project and Ned B. Allen Professor of English and Black Studies. âAs critical as the anti-slavery movement was, their broader vision continues to speak to this countryâs ongoing racial challenges.â The Colored Conventions Project is an interdisciplinary digital humanities project that aims to bring the history of the convention movementâand the many leaders and places involved in itâto digital life. “Transcribe Minutes uses crowd-sourcing technologies to promote online access to these historical records,” says Jim Casey, project co-coordinator and a Ph.D. candidate in UDâs English department. “These technologies open up new possibilities for our research and teaching beyond college classrooms.” ColoredConventions.orgÂ houses the first digital collection of these minutes, many of which were previously out of print and hard to find. It features more than 65 national and state minutes from 1830 to well beyond the Civil Warâ–with more being uncovered and added regularly. âAttention to African American experience in the nineteenth century is usually focused on the efforts of Northern white abolitionists to end the âpeculiar institutionâ of slavery,â says Carol A. Rudisell, UD Reference and Instructional Services librarian. âHaving accurate, searchable texts should significantly change our understanding of this important period.â Transcribing and making these records more usable requires collective efforts. Volunteers will help give new life to a vital chapter of American history. âThe more people involved, the more we can preserve and call attention to one of the major ignored chapters of American history,â says Curtis Smalls, a Special Collections librarian and member of CCP. The project is an exciting collaboration between faculty, students and librarians,â he continues. âThe Colored Convention Project is important for its method as well as its results,â says John Ernest, Chair of the English Department at UD. âItâs an inspiring and instructive model of collaborative research,â Ernest adds. âThis is a historical recovery project that will teach us volumes about African American communities of the past while strengthening numerous and diverse communities in the present.â This work is the product of an ongoing partnership between the Colored Conventions Project and the University of Delaware Library.   The Colored Conventions Project www.coloredconventions.org coloredconventions@udel.edu
