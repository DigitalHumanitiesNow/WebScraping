The McGill CiteLab is a newly formed group â we’re starting small, with Andrew Piper and Mark Algee-Hewitt. As a forthcoming post will explain in more detail, we’re inspired by groups like the Stanford Literary Lab, though our own interests go beyond literary texts to include a wide range of cultural artifacts (though still mostly textual). Our first real work meeting was today, and I’ve posted some information and code on initial experiments with data from world music charts (I’ve made a concerted effort to make my post somewhat pedagogical and reproducible in nature, for those who may be interested in following along at home).
