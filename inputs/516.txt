[This post is re-published from an invited response to a February 2014Â MediaCommons question of the week: “How can we better use data and/or research visualization in the humanities?” I forgot I had written it! so thought I would cross-post it, belatedly, to my blog. Many thanks to Kevin Smith, a student in Ryan Cordell’s Northeastern University digital humanities course, for reminding me. Read his “Direct visualization as/is a tactical term,” here.] Neatline, a digital storytelling tool from theÂ Scholarsâ LabÂ at the University of Virginia Library, anticipates this weekâsÂ MediaCommonsÂ discussion question in three clear ways. But before I get to that, let me tell you whatÂ Neatline is.  Itâs aÂ geotemporalÂ exhibit-builder that allows you to create beautiful, complex maps, image annotations, and narrative sequences from collections of documents and artifacts, and to connect your maps and narratives with timelines that are more-than-usually sensitive to ambiguity and nuance.Â NeatlineÂ (which is free andÂ open source) lets you make hand-crafted, interactive stories as interpretive expressions of a single document or a whole archival or cultural heritage collection. Now, let me tell you whatÂ NeatlineÂ isnât. Itâs not a Google Map. If you simply want to drop pins on modern landscapes and provide a bit of annotation,Â NeatlineÂ is obvious overkill â but stick around. How doesÂ NeatlineÂ respond to theÂ MediaCommonsÂ question of the week? 1)Â Â  First, as an add-on toÂ Omeka, the most stable and well-supported open source content management system designed specifically for cultural heritage data,Â NeatlineÂ understands libraries, archives and museums as the data-stores of the humanities. Scholars are able either to build new digital collections forÂ NeatlineÂ annotation and storytelling inÂ OmekaÂ themselves, or to capitalize on existing, robust, professionally-produced humanities metadata by usingÂ other plug-insÂ to import records from another system. These could range from robust digital repositories (FedoraConnector) to archival finding aids (EADimporter) to structured data of any sort, gleaned from sources like spreadsheets, XML documents, and APIs (CSVimport,Â OAI-PMHÂ Harvester, Shared Shelf Link etc.). 2)Â Â  Second,Â NeatlineÂ was carefully designedÂ by humanities scholars and DH practitionersÂ to emphasize what we found most humanistic about interpretive scholarship, and most compelling about small data in a big data world. Its timelines and drawing tools are respectful of ambiguity, uncertainty, and subjectivity, and allow for multipleÂ aestheticsÂ to emerge and be expressed. The platform itself isÂ architectedÂ so as to allow multiple, complementary or even wholly conflicting interpretations to be layered over the same, core set of humanities data. This data is understood to be unstable (in the best sense of the term) â extensible, never fixed or complete â and able to be enriched, enhanced, and altered by the activity of the scholar or curator. 3)Â Â  Finally,Â NeatlineÂ sees visualization itself as part of the interpretive process of humanities scholarship â not as an algorithmically-generated, push-button result or a macro-view for distant reading â but as something created minutely, manually, andÂ iteratively, to draw our attention to small things and unfold it there.Â NeatlineÂ sees humanities visualization not as a result but as a process: as an interpretive act that will itself â inevitably â be changed by its own particular and unique course of creation. Â Knowing that every algorithmic data visualization process is inherently interpretive is different from feeling it, as a productive resistance in the materials of digital data visualization. So users ofÂ NeatlineÂ are prompted to formulate their arguments by drawing them.Â They drawÂ across landscapes (real or imaginary, photographed by todayâs satellites or plotted by cartographers of years gone by), across timelines that allow for imprecision, across the gloss and grain of images of various kinds, and with and over printed or manuscript texts.
