 A View Becomes a Window, 2013 from Studio Olafur Eliasson on Vimeo. Olafur Eliassonâs A View Becomes a Window, created for Ivorypress, is an edition of nine unique, leather-bound books containing a variety of glass pages of various colours, qualities, and degrees of opacity. When the pages are turned, the layers of coloured glass create complex reflections, so that the viewer becomes the protagonist of the bookâs playful mirror narrative. via @jomc
