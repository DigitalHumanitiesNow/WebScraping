    Cassandra Pybus, Epic Journeys of Freedom: Runaway Slaves of the American Revolution and Their Global Quest for Liberty. Boston: Beacon Press, 2007. via Beacon Press:  “The astounding story of runaway slaves during the American Revolution and the lives they forged on four continents. “During the American Revolution, thousands of slaves fled from their masters to find freedom with the British. Having emancipated themselves–and with rhetoric about the inalienable rights of free men ringing in their ears–these men and women struggled tenaciously to make liberty a reality in their lives. This alternative narrative includes the stories of dozens of individuals–including Harry, one of George Washingtonâs slaves–who left America and forged difficult new lives in far-flung corners of the British Empire. Written in the best tradition of history from the bottom up, this pathbreaking work will alter the way we think about the American Revolution.”Filed under: Cassandra Pybus Tagged: african diaspora, book, canada, free people of color, history, maroonage, north america, slavery, united states
