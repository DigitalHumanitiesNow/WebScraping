Design Observer had an interesting post last week on different ways people have beem mapping cyberspace and computer use. Design Observer observes:  Of course, it is the internet that has changed our perception of space, precisely because the sheer volume of interconnectivity is beyond our imagination, whether it be language-based, data-based, or community-based. Add black holes and photographs of asteroidal moons around Jupiter, and our world seems increasingly expansive. Yet, if we cannot map it, how can we understand it?   This image (click the thumbnail to enlarge) is a map of someone mouse movement for a week. The mouse cursor traveled an estimated 5.5 miles. Other maps include the popular tag maps (like del.icio.us or Flickr use) and this interesting map of email communication at the New York Times. One commentor also linked to Wordcount, which works like a heat map of the most popular words in the English language. Wordcount gets its data from the British National Corpus.
