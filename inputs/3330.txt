Its application season again for the Summer Institute in Museum Anthropology. As noted recently on the American Folklore Society website: “The Summer Institute in Museum Anthropology (SIMA), supported by the Smithsonian Institution and the National Science Foundation, is accepting applications for its 2015 program in Washington, DC to be held June 22-July 17. SIMA is an intensive museum research methods training program for graduate students, offered in residence at the Department of Anthropology in the Smithsonian Institutionâs National Museum of Natural History. Graduate students at the masters or doctoral level who are preparing for research careers and are interested in using museum collections as a data source should apply. Although primarily oriented to cultural anthropology, students in related programs (Indigenous Studies, Folklore, etc.) are welcome to apply if the proposed project is anthropological in nature.” Learn a lot more about SIMA on the program website: http://anthropology.si.edu/summerinstitute/ I am excited to be returning to SIMA 2015 as a visiting faculty member. Thanks to the National Science Foundation and the Smithsonian Institution for its great support of the Institute.Filed under: Anthropology, Folklore Studies, Material Culture, Museum Anthropology, SIMA
