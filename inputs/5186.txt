But for lovers or friends with no past in common the historic past unrolls like a park, like a ridgy landscape full of buildings and people. Â To talk of books is, for oppressed shut-in lovers, no way out of themselves; what was written is either dull or too near the heart. Â But to walk into history is to be free at once, to be at large among people. Â Art does its work even here in clarifying their faces, but they are dead, immune, their schemes and passions are legacies….Outside, the street, empty, reeled in the midday sun; the glare was reflected in on the gold-and-brown restaurant wall opposite; side by side in the empty restaurant, they surrounded themselves with wars, treaties, persecutions, strategic marriages, campaigns, reforms, successions and violent deaths. Â History is unpainful, memory does not cloud it; you join the emphatic lives of the long dead. Â May we give the future something to talk about. –Elizabeth Bowen, The House in Paris
