Now that we’ve revised the THATCamp Council Charter and have worked out the election process, I want to encourage everyone who thinks they might be eligible, able, and willing to run for the THATCamp Council to do so. In the last ten days or so I’ve been calling for candidates on the THATCamp organizers email list, and we do already have several excellent candidates for the 4 open seats, but I’m well aware that not everyone who has helped organize a THATCamp is on that list. If you haven’t been following the THATCamp Council Charter revision process, here are the answers to some questions you might have about the Council.Who is eligible to run for the THATCamp Council?Anyone who has helped organize a THATCamp will be eligible to serve on the Council.What are the responsibilities of THATCamp Council members?Supporting THATCamp organizers, participants, and would-be participants, especially byanswering questions on the THATCamp forumscreating and revising help documents on thatcamp.orgmanaging THATCamp social media accountsattending and/or organizing THATCampsUpholding core THATCamp valuesSetting the long-term direction of the THATCamp projectCreating and revising community processes, policies, and governance documentsResolving community conflictsHow long is the term?Council terms (including the term of the Chair and the RRCHNM representative) are two years long, but members can hold an unlimited number of terms if they are reelected or reappointed.How often will the Council meet?The Council will meet at least three times per year for the purpose of discussing and (if necessary) voting on issues of interest to the THATCamp Community. In general, meetings can take place online, via conference call, or in person.How do I run for the Council?Write *protected email* by Monday, 3/17 indicating that you’d like to run. Include a few lines about why you want to run for the THATCamp Council, perhaps also addressing why you think THATCamp is important and/or directions you’d like to see THATCamp go.When will the election take place?I’d like to open the week-long voting period by the end of the day on Monday, 3/17. I’ll post your reasons for running that day along with a link to your THATCamp profile, available from our People page at thatcamp.org/people. The election process is described more fully in the THATCamp Council Charter.Please see the THATCamp Council Charter if you have more questions, or of course write me (THATCamp Council Chair pro tem) at *protected email*.
