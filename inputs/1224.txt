This blog is now silent: all my blogging has now moved to my new blog Manicule. If you’re following this blog, feel free to explore the new one and follow me there (all my previous posts are archived on the new blog). I’ve been running two blogs simultaneously, but I’m now slightly more realistic about the quantity of posting that I’m capable of, and since all my blogging concerns the eighteenth-century in one way or another (and indeed, some posts have been doing double-duty) I’m hoping I won’t lose any of my dear followers.
