Digital Humanitarians are responding in full force to the devastating earthquake that struck Nepal. Information sharing and coordination is taking place online via CrisisMappersÂ and onÂ multiple dedicated Skype chats.Â The Standby Task Force (SBTF), Humanitarian OpenStreetMap (HOT) and others from the Digital Humanitarian Network (DHN) have also deployed in response toÂ the tragedy. This blog post provides a quick summary of some of these digital humanitarian efforts along with what’s coming in terms of new deployments. Update: A list of Crisis Maps for Nepal is available below.  At the request of the UNÂ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the SBTF is usingÂ QCRI’s MicroMappers platformÂ to crowdsource the analysis of tweets and mainstream media (the latter via GDELT) to rapidly 1) assess disasterÂ damage & needs; and 2) Identify where humanitarian groups are deploying (3W’s). The MicroMappers CrisisMaps are already live and publicly available below (simply click on the maps to open live version). BothÂ Crisis Maps are being updated hourly (at times every 15 minutes). Note that MicroMappers also uses both crowdsourcing and ArtificialÂ Intelligence (AIDR). Update: More than 1,200 Digital Jedis haveÂ used MicroMappers toÂ sift through a staggering 35,000 images and 7,000 tweets! This has so far resulted in 300+ relevant pictures of disaster damage displayed on the Image Crisis Map and over 100 relevant disaster tweets on the Tweet Crisis Map. Live CrisisMap of pictures from both Twitter and Mainstream Media showing disasterÂ damage:  Live CrisisMap of Urgent Needs, Damage and Response Efforts posted on Twitter:  Note: theÂ outstandingÂ Kathmandu Living Labs (KLL) team have also launched an Ushahidi Crisis Map in collaboration with the Nepal Red Cross. We’ve already invitedÂ invited KLL to take all of the MicroMappers data and add it to their crisis map. Supporting local efforts is absolutely key.  The Humanitarian UAV Network (UAViators) has also been activated to identify, mobilize and coordinate UAV assets & teams. Several professional UAV teams are already on their way to Kathmandu.Â The UAV pilots will be producingÂ high resolution nadir imagery, oblique imagery and 3D point clouds.Â UAViators will be pushing this imagery to bothÂ HOT and MicroMappers for rapid crowdsourced analysis (just like was done with the aerial imagery from Vanuatu post Cyclone Pam, more on that here).Â A leading UAV manufacturer is also donating several UAVs to UAViators for use in Nepal. These UAVs will be sent toÂ KLL to support their efforts.Â In the meantime,Â DigitalGlobe,Â Planet LabsÂ andÂ SkyBox are each sharing their satellite imagery with CrisisMappers, HOT and others in the Digital Humanitarian Network. There areÂ several other efforts going on, so the above is certainly not a complete list but simplyÂ reflect thoseÂ digital humanitarian efforts that I am involved in or most familiar with. If you know of other major efforts, then please feel free to post them in the comments section. Thank you. More onÂ the state of the art in digital humanitarian action in my new book, Digital Humanitarians. List of Nepal Crisis Maps Please add to theÂ list below by posting new links in thisÂ Google Spreadsheet. Also,Â someone should really create 1Â map that pulls from each of the listed maps.
