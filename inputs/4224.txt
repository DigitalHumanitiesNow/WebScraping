SLIS News Story:  http://www.slis.indiana.edu/news/story.php?story_id=2186 We have some new publicity on the Chymistry of Isaac Newton project.  IU did a press release on the launch of new manuscripts, new website design, and new features… and I get some credit for redesigning the website.  I’ve had a really great time working on the Newton Project with Dr. John A Walsh, Dr. William Newman, Wally Hooper, and the rest of the crew.  We’ve had some good times.  Now I’m moving on to the TILE project (Text-Image Linking Environment) and I’ll be working with Doug Reside, Dot Porter, Melissa Terras, and Dr. John A Walsh.
