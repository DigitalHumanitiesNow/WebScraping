During the month of December I am participating in #reverb14 as a means of getting my writing habits back on track. I will be altering the prompts as needed to fit within the scope of this blog. Today's prompt: Coulda woulda shoulda. What didn't you do this year because you were too scared, afraid, unsure? Are you going to o it next year? Or maybe you don't want to anymore.I passed on a number of projects this year that I felt I couldn't commit enough time to. I stand by my decision to prioritize projects and work toward a balanced life. That being said it was hard to pass up offers to contribute to a couple book projects and conference panels that focused on community archives, Indigenous heritage, and archival outreach. There is always next year, especially in the case of the National Council on Public History annual conference and various Canadian archival conferences. My status as a new parent has made me acutely aware of the lack of supports built into conferences for parents. I believe the Society of American Archivists has offered minimal childcare arrangements atÂ past conferences but very few academic conferences offer this service. Practically I put conference presenting on hold while I adjust to life as a mother. This past year has been filled with prioritization. I can't do everything and I shouldn't feel the need to try to do everything. I keep reminding myself that saying no is okay.
