The Global Classroom Experiment was recently fingered by ASU News for breaking down the boundaries of the traditional classroom. You can read the entire article here. One of the most powerful examples of a mediated classroom is located in the C-wing of the Life Sciences building, where âSustainable Cities: a Contradiction in Terms?â is being taught simultaneously to students at ASU and at Leuphana University in Germany. Twenty ASU students sit at tabletop computers surrounded by numerous large screens, taught in person by two of the top professors at ASU. Another 20 are tuned in from Germany. Still another 20 students from each country are in adjoining classrooms working on research projects, as part of a second cohort of the three-semester class. The Global Classroom, a pilot project funded by a $900,000 award from the Mercator Foundation, utilizes video conferencing; intensive writing assignments and student writing workshops; online exhibits; peer-to-peer mentoring; and in-person international exchange.
