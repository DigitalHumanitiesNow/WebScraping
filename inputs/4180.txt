I’ve been spending most of my time the past few years on other sites, mostly shorter messages on Twitter and Facebook. It’s hit me that blogging, or at least longwinded thinking out loud, was always beneficial. I met people, could think though ideas without (much) consequence, and get practice writing (which is always a great thing). So, I’m back. And this is linked to my website so there’s some accountability. Or something.
