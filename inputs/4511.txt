 THIS BLOG HAS MOVED HERE, a lovely site housed by the good folks at Reclaim Hosting, where Iâ€™ll be consolidating all my various academic and non-academic Internet activities. Please adjust your bookmarks, rss feeds or however you reach this blog accordingly. While all new posts will appear there, I have decided to keep all the old ones up here for convenience sake. Thanks for reading and I look forward to seeing you at the new site soon.
