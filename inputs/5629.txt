 “You are all starting out with As.” “Great!” I thought, “Then I’m good. Â I can only hurt my math grade by doing any work.” So started my first semester in public school when I was in the 6th grade. Â The school I attended for grades 1-5 was tiny. Â Four grades in one room, tiny. Â When I read theÂ Little House on the Prarie books the small one-room school house seemed totally believable and not too remote. Soon my notions of cruising Â through math class with an A were dispelled when the teacher brought my mother in for a conference. Â I was in danger of failing the class because lining her grade book was a neat row of zeros behind my name. Â I had not earned any points. Fast-forward 28 years and I’m grading papers for the first time. Â Evaluating student writing and trying to provide them with individual feedback so they can improve. Â After I graded the first batch of papers a student came to me and wanted to talk about her grade. Â I was excited because then I could elaborate on the comments I’d painstakingly provided throughout their essay. Â When our meeting happened the student could not understand the disconnect between what they wrote and the assignment sheet. Â In some ways I felt like I was just talking in circles with the student but I was really trying to lead them to the conclusion. Â The student told me that their HS English teacher would just “mark up the paper so I knew everything I did wrong.” The student then went onto say “The teacher would show me exactly what I needed to change.” Â But then here they sat, next to me and unable to read through an assignment sheet. Â However, what the student said next left more of an impact. “Just tell me why you took points off.” A single sentence echoing through my brain for a month. Â “…why you took points off.” Moments like that new does not come close to describing my actual feelings. Â I wanted to say, “You do not start out with a 100 and I deduct. You start with a 0 and earn points.” Â These were not points I took off but rather you score reflects the points you earn. Simple.
