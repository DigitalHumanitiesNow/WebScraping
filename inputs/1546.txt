There is an edge for each “replies-to” relationship in a tweet, an edge for each “mentions” relationship in a tweet, and a self-loop edge for each tweet that is not a “replies-to” or “mentions”.The graph’s vertices were grouped by cluster using the Clauset-Newman-Moore cluster algorithm.Â The graph was laid out using the Harel-Koren Fast Multiscale layout algorithm.The edge colors are based on edge weight values. The edge widths are based on edge weight values. The edge opacities are based on edge weight values. The vertex sizes are based on followers values. The vertex opacities are based on followers values.Top 10 Vertices, Ranked by Betweenness Centrality: @ieheather @ie_analytics @mayadroeschler @iejoanna @david_green_uk @retailedi @paulbdnb @ie_bigdata @iechloet @merapps   Top Hashtags in Tweet in Entire Graph: #iesocialweb #analytics #socialmedia #hranalytics #pasandiego #ff #hr #bigdata #hranalyticsldn #socialTop URLs in Tweet in Entire Graph:http://theinnovationenterprise.com/summits/social-media-web-analytics-san-francisco-2014http://theinnovationenterprise.com/summits/predictive-analytics-san-diego-2014/schedulehttp://theinnovationenterprise.com/summits/social-media-web-analytics-san-francisco-2014?utm_content=buffere1c8a&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=bufferhttp://theinnovationenterprise.com/summits/HR-analytics-london-2014#sthash.dozYpnql.uxfshttp://www.forbes.com/sites/benkerschberg/2014/01/31/semantria-text-analytics-business-intelligence-big-data/?utm_content=buffera317b&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=bufferhttp://www.hrintelligenceblog.com/en/?p=916#.Uw5DXrA3hsc.twitterhttp://theinnovationenterprise.com/summits/social-media-web-analytics-san-francisco-2014/schedulehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-WDvnx6ewo&feature=sharehttp://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jun/10/social-media-analytics-sentiment-analysis?utm_content=buffer6c2da&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=bufferhttp://www.scoop.it/t/social-web-analytics/p/4016572034/2014/02/25/boost-your-social-strategy-with-seo-data
