  Exciting news! A bit delayed, but I just got word that our panel was accepted. Yay! See you all in Vancouver!   I’m very excited to share a panel proposal for the upcoming MLA 2015 in Vancouver, BC, entitledÂ “Generic Interventions: Print and Media Narratives of Global South Cities.” The session is organized byÂ Leigh Anne Duck andÂ Sabine Haenni, who put together a beautifully compelling and cohesive proposal that spans the cities of North Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Fingers crossed! Many thanks to the organizers and panelists for giving me permission to post and share this here. <3 Panel Narrative| In focusing on urban sites of the Global South that have been and remain the location of rapid industrialization, technological development and concomitant social (often transnational) fractures, this panel asks how generic narrative structures both portray and intervene in dominant ideas of development. Comparative and collaborative analysis across spaces that have experienced colonization and acute economic exploitation has been a priority for postcolonial discourse since before the Bandung Conference, and Global South studies offers the additional opportunity to examine contemporary forms of deterritorialized capital, which is particularly visible in urban areas. Because such scholarship requires engaging realms of knowledge that extend beyond not only research conducted in a particular language but also interdisciplinary area studies (such as African, Latin American, or Southeast Asian), our goal is, in part, to expand dialogue on the Global South at MLA. Momentum for this shift increased at the 2014 convention, as panels explored the methodologies associated with specific global regions (“Futures of South-South Comparison”), questioned the term “Global South” from the perspective of diverse nations and global regions (“What Is the Global South?”), and considered the institutional contexts and material media through which such conversations have occurred in the past (“World Literature and the Global South”). We pursue this goal through addressing spatial and formal concerns shared across geographies: the genres used to interrogate urban experience. Ten years after a special issue of Social Text on “Global Cities of the South”âa decade that has been shaped, in narrative studies, by the emergence of world literature as a powerful paradigm in dialogue with comparative and postcolonial literaturesâour study of urban genres in the Global South combines close and distant reading practices to consider how local circumstances and broad narrative patterns mutually intervene. Without presuming that genre works in a singular way, and without presuming that genres work in the Global South in the same way they do in the Global North, it examines the multiple ways in which generic structures are appropriated and mobilized for a critique of often ruthless urban development. To that purpose, we explore genres across print and film media. Papers will be held to 16 minutes in order to allow time for a brief (5-minute) response, which will emphasize how these analyses of distinct narrative forms and spaces contribute to scholarship concerning narratives of the Global South. The first paper, âSaigon/Ho Chi Minh City, or the Aspirational Socialist Oriented Southeast Asian City,â looks at how horror film intervenes in the narratives of urban growth so typical of emerging tech-hubs in the Southern hemisphere. Since Vietnamâs Reunification in 1975, and a transition to a âsocialist oriented market economy,â the megalopolis Saigon/Ho Chi Minh City has seen dramatic development marked by escalating disparities. Focusing specifically on PhÃº Má»¹ HÆ°ng, a region of Saigon South that has grown along science-fiction proportions (even by the standards of a city that has generally seen enormous development), this paper argues that the horror film–a genre discouraged by cultural authorities as recently as 2007–challenges the official media representations offered by the PhÃº Má»¹ HÆ°ng Corporation, which is responsible for much of this development. Where corporate media represent PhÃº Má»¹ HÆ°ngâs pristine, contained residential and consumer environments as idyllically ready for occupation by global elites, the film Giá»¯a Hai Tháº¿ Giá»i (2011), in particular, uses these luxury homes as a setting that disrupts notions of security and tranquility associated with the modern homes of such exclusive areas. In doing so, it responds to Western notions of modernity and critiques the representation of Saigon as an aspirational city that aims to âcatch upâ to their American and European counterparts. While the first presentation focuses on the horror genreâs intervention into the Southern aspirational megalopolis, the second, âThe Port City in the Arabic and French Imaginary,â considers how noir narratives represent diasporic hubsâMarseille, Casablanca and Tangierâaround the Mediterranean.Â Here, genre works in different ways. Although Jean-Claude Izzoâs innovative trilogy — Total KhÃ©ops, Chourmo, and SolÃ©a -famously charts the darker side of Marseilleâs Mediterranean cityscape, where organized crime, political corruption, poverty, and violence speak of the cityâs position as a site of both diaspora and departure, the vision of Marseille in Izzoâs work is interlaced with a nostalgia and hidden optimism. Here, homecoming and the possibility of assimilation are figured into the texts through their very structure. By contrast, the fragmented narratives by authors Mohamed Choukri, Muhammad Zafzaf, and Youssef Fadel narrate the lives of the smugglers, prostitutes, drug traffickers, and profiteers of clandestine immigration in Casablanca and Tangier with a stark desperation. These port cities invariably represent a demarcated and claustrophobic space of restriction and impasse. Together, these noir narratives map a world literary system maintaining center/periphery, North/South distinctions within a genre. Finally, âRogues in the Postcolonyâ turns to the coming of age tale or the bildungsroman in Chris Abaniâs and Patrick Chamoiseauâs fiction set in Lagos and Martinique respectively. While the traditional buildungsroman has been read as a proxy for the continued efforts of empire building and development writ large, the âsturdy rogueâ living in any of a number of cities in the Global South functions as both a remonstrance and a sort of parody. Abaniâs and Chamoiseauâs postcolonial picaros cut a strange geographyâliterally carving a life out of the detritus of empireâand depart from the âteleological sense of directionâ of the bildungsroman. This rogue in the postcolony lives not in a surreal âapokalisâ as in, e.g., Indra Sinhaâs Animalâs People, but in the âshadows between institutionsââsites of colonial exception writ large. These new picaresque structures are âuncannily effectiveâ in capturing the sorts of structural (or âslowâ) violence enacted by neoliberal regimes in both sites. Main subject: Comparative Literature Main subsubject: Twentieth Century Keywords: Global South, genres, cities, postcolonial Participants: This panel gathers experts from different Global South disciplines and regions, in part to generateÂ dialogue among these constituencies. The presenters are trained in literature departments and mediaÂ studies, and in each case their presentation is part of a larger workâa book or a dissertationâonÂ urban representation in the Global South. The chair and the respondent have put together this panelÂ because they are collaborating on a special issue of the journal The Global South, edited by theÂ respondent, on narrating, mediating and visualizing cities of the Global South. Presider: Sabine Haenni isÂ associate professor in the Department of Performing and Media Arts and the director ofÂ the American Studies Program at Cornell University, has published on migration and urbanism inÂ literature and film. Her book, The Immigrant Scene: Ethnic Amusements in New York, 1880-1920Â (University of Minnesota Press, 2008), looked at how popular theatre and early cinema helped mediateÂ new urban realities in New York City by enabling different public cultures in immigrant neighborhoodsÂ and on Broadway. She is currently working on a second monograph, Port and Periphery: CinematicÂ Urbanism in Mediterranean Marseille, which considers how the cinematic geographies generated inÂ this Southern European port city reframe questions of labor, traffic, migration and exile. Her work hasÂ appeared in journals such as American Literature, Cinema Journal, Theatre Research International,Â and Journal of Film and Video; she is co-editing a special issue of The Global South, on Global SouthÂ port cities. Presenters: Anne Cong-Huyen is a Mellon Visiting Assistant Professor of Asian American Studies at UC LosÂ Angeles. Her research examines Los Angeles, Dubai, and Ho Chi Minh City through the paradigm ofÂ âglobal citiesâ in order to problematize the seductive archetype that has enormous cache and that hasÂ paved the way for neoliberal economic policy to catalyze growth, development, and competition. SheÂ resituates the supremacy of the Global North by reading Los Angeles as a city of the Asia-Pacific inÂ relation to burgeoning economic capitals in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Her particular work onÂ Saigon/Ho Chi Minh City resists facile readings of global cities indexes that flatten urban localesÂ through metrics that measure the health and potential of urban centers. Through a multi-sited,Â comparative media analysis, she contests the notion of emerging cities of the Third World or GlobalÂ South as being aspirational, and provides a broader media ecology for studying global cities. Her work appears in The Journal of e-Media Studies, and is forthcoming in Humanities and the Digital (MITÂ Press). She has previously published on comics in the Asian American literature class, and is alsoÂ active as a founding member of the #transformDH collective. Gretchen HeadÂ holds a PhD in Arabic literature from the University of Pennsylvania and is currently aÂ Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow in the Humanities and Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department ofÂ Comparative Literature at the University of California, Berkeley. At Berkeley, she teaches upper level undergraduate and graduate courses on how the Arabic tradition can be incorporated into newÂ paradigms of world literature with a particular focus on the intersection of geography and narrative.Â While she is completing a monograph on Moroccan autobiographical writing in Arabic, her interest inÂ the relationship between space and literary representation has led to an additional coedited volume inÂ progress on the city in premodern and modern Arabic literature. She has published articles andÂ reviews in Alif: Journal of Comparative Poetics, AkhbÄr al-adab, Arab Studies Journal, The Journal of Arabic Literature, Jadaliyya Ezine, Portal 9, Warscapes, Womenâs Studies Quarterly, and The LebanonÂ Daily Star and has a book chapter on Tunisian womenâs narratives of resistance under Ben AliÂ forthcoming in Gender Politics and the Arab Spring (UNEP/Brandeis University Press). She has been aÂ contributor to Words without Borders and is the translator of Mohamed Choukriâs Paul Bowles, theÂ Recluse of Tangier, published by Telegram Books in 2008. StaceyÂ BalkanÂ is a PhD candidate in English at the CUNY Graduate Center where her work focuses onÂ postcolonial ecologies and the politics of representation in the Global South. She is writing herÂ dissertation on picaresque novels that illuminate the margins of empire; in these novels, narrativeÂ arcs are circumscribed by the âslow violenceâ caused by neoliberal investment schemes,Â environmental devastation and other means of structural displacement. She looks at the postcolonialÂ picaro/aâpersons in cities like Lagos and Lima, who live in the âshadows between institutions.âÂ Balkanâs recent publications include âLatin American Semiotics: Metropolitan (Im)migrants in theÂ âLettered Cityââ on Purdue UPâs CLC Web and a chapter on abjection in the work of Roberto BolaÃ±o inÂ the Companion to Comparative Literature, World Literatures and Comparative Cultural StudiesÂ (Cambridge UP India, 2013). Both works consider narrative formulations appropriate to the newÂ lettered cities of the Global Southâthose âimaginary spectaclesâ that all too often recall their colonial forebears. Balkan also teaches Latin American Literature and composition at Bergen CommunityÂ College where she is an Assistant Professor and co-chairs the collegeâs Literary Arts Series. Respondent:  Leigh Anne Duck is an Associate Professor of English at the University of Mississippi, where she editsÂ the journal The Global South. Her research concerns literary and visual representations of the U.S.Â South, often using comparative and transnational methodologies to analyze representations ofÂ economic and racial exploitation. Her work has appeared in such venues as American Literary History,Â CR: New Centennial Review, and the volumes The American South and the Atlantic World (UP ofÂ Florida, 2013) and Look Away: The U.S. South in New World Studies (Duke UP, 2004). Her book TheÂ Nation’s Region: Southern Modernism, Segregation, and U.S. Nationalism (2006) examined howÂ national responses (as exemplified in journalistic commentary and policy discourse) to bothÂ experimental southern literature and racial segregation were shaped by conceptions of nationalÂ economic modernization. Her current book project, Hollywood South: State, Cinema, and NeoliberalÂ Nationhood, situates the Louisiana film industry in relation to global pursuits of economic growthÂ through âcreative industriesâ; it explores how films produced with state incentives register changingÂ understandings of collective and political life.
