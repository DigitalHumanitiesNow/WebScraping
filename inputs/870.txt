 Please join me for a NodeXL meetup onÂ April 23Â at 3pm local time in Amsterdam at an event hosted by DTN/NewsConsole. Location:Â Prinsengracht 707-3  Bring your SNA, social media, social network, and NodeXL questions along with sample data sets! Come hear about NodeXL features that make automating network data collection, analysis, visualization and publication simple and easy. Â Get daily reports on the social networks that matter to you! I will talk about the upcoming features releasing in NodeXL (autoupdate, new layouts, better importers for Twitter, Facebook, Wikis, and more) and take your requests. We may have some special guests!
