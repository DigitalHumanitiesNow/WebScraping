I watched Peter Diamandis give a presentation yesterday (at the Michigan CEO Summit) â among other things, he showed a video of Watson absolutely dominating in Jeopardy and mentioned, offhand, that Watson has an API now.    My ears perked up, and one Google search and a few clicks later, I confirmed what Iâve long suspected: AI is coming for my job.    But donât worry, fellow wordsmiths and rhetoricians: the only audience you can optimize for, under Watsonâs current public incarnation as Bluemix, is the crowd of Twitter users interested in two topics:  Cloud     Big Data And that, if youâll forgive the somewhat laborious introduction, is why I’m thinking about clouds.  1  Much like its tropospheric namesake, you can see almost anything in the digital cloud if you stare at it long enough. Panopticon? Library of Babel? Sum total of human knowledge? Yes, yes, yes, all of the above. So why do we persist in using only one word to mean so many things?  Iâd like to propose a new classification system. Instead of just talking about âthe cloudâ, as in âthis app syncs with the cloudâ or âI keep all my photos in the cloud nowâ or âEver since Snowden, I just donât trust the cloudâ â letâs be more specific.  Clouds and Clouds  Cirrus clouds are light, wispy, more decorative than consequential.  2  Moving over to the digital world, a cirrus cloud primarily stores metadata, and you wouldnât really miss if it disappeared. For example, Chrome browser sync â itâs nice to have your bookmarks on all your computers, but not something you couldnât live without. GameCenter on iOS keeps track of your leaderboard rankings and syncs your game progress, but you donât really âkeepâ anything in GameCenter.  Cumulus clouds are hefty, voluminous, big.  3  A cumulus cloud is a storehouse for heaps of data, like that 25GB of correspondence over a decade in your Gmail account, or photo backups on Dropbox, or your iTunes library.  Stratus clouds are flat sheets, sometimes layered. People donât take many photos of stratus clouds, because frankly theyâre not very impressive.  4  A stratus cloud is important, but itâs not customer-facing. Amazon AWS, Github, Heroku â workhorses, one and all, but unless youâre a developer you probably neither know nor care.  And then there are nimbus clouds â the ones that promise rain, sleet, snow, hail. Or worse.  5  Nimbus clouds are the dark internet, the alphabet soup of NSA programs, the hacked credit card and password databases getting passed around the back alleys of the net. The cloud that rains on your parade when your identity gets stolen: thatâs a nimbus.  This is just scratching the surface of cloud-related terminology, but it’s a start – and hopefully a useful one. What do you think?
