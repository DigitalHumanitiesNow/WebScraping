A few days ago, we received letters from Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) giving us notice to appear at citizenship tests . . . on June 3rd!  That was about two months earlier than I expected. Unfortunately/fortunately, we’ll be in Oregon as Carrie’s giving two talks at UO, so I called their toll-free number.  I got an agent, explained that our stay in the US was extended by fellowships at USC, and that we really really want to do it at the end of August.  She told me we simply had to write a letter to CIC’s office in Montreal asking for a later test, and that they would send us new dates.  Simple.  I immediately composed the ingratiating letter, which will go out tomorrow.  Apparently, so many people miss the first date given for their citizenship tests that they are automatically rescheduled — you don’t even have to do anything about it.  Amazing. For anyone wanting to study along with us, the study guide is here.
