  Duane W. Roller’s remarkable new English translation of Strabo’s Geography is now available from Cambridge University Press ( ISBN: 9781107038257; e-book ISBN: 9781139950374). To accompany it, the Center has produced a seamless, interactive online map which is accessible free:Â http://awmc.unc.edu/awmc/applications/strabo.Â  The map is built on theÂ Antiquity Ã-la-carteÂ interface, and has immense coverage because it plots all the locatable geographical and cultural features mentioned in the 17 books of this fundamentally important Greek source â over 3,000 of them, stretching from Ireland to the Ganges delta and deep into north Africa. In the e-version of the translation, the gazetteer offers embedded hyperlinks to each toponymâs stable URI within the digital module, making it possible to move directly between Straboâs text and its cartographicÂ realization.
