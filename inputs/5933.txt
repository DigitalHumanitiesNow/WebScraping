I have been following the coverage of the Canadian election with my usual-wish-I-could-vote interest. Everyone is so exercised about coalitions.  But Canada’s a constitutional monarchy.  It’s got a parliament.  What exactly do you call it when no party wins a majority and then other parties vote with them to keep them in power?  I think we already have a coalition and have had them for quite some time now. . . .
