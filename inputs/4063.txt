Last August the Boston Digital Humanities Consortium formed âto pursue shared funding opportunities; organize a series of events; network with digital humanities centers, organizations, and societies worldwide; and encourage local discussion of digital humanities and related topics.â They now have a website where you can subscribe to their mailing list. They also have the most comprehensive news and calendar for Boston-area DH events, so itâs worth checking out. If you want to be able to post events to the siteâs blog, you can e-mail Dave Wedaman.
