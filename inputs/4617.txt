Over the course of the Spring semester of 2015, Dr. Angel David Nieves and our âIntro to Digital Humanitiesâ have worked together to develop "Jazz and the City," a collection of Scalar-based presentations showcasing the content of the Fillius Jazz Archive at Hamilton College, in an effort to find, recover, and advocate for voices from marginalized communities. Â The project's goals are listed as: dhi,   projects,   news,   jazz,   city,   scalar,   students
