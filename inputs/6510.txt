Our Book Display Widgets is getting adopted by more and more libraries, and we’re busy making it better and better. Last week we introduced Easy Share. This week we’re rolling out another improvementâAnnotations! Book Display Widgets is the ultimate tool for libraries to create automatic or hand-picked virtual book displays for their home page, blog, Facebook or elsewhere. Annotations allows libraries to add explanations for their picks.  Some Ways to Use Annotations 1. Explain Staff Picks right on your homepage. 2. Let students know if a book is reserved for a particular class. 3. Add context for special collections displays. How it Works Check out the LibraryThing for Libraries Wiki for instructions on how to add Annotations to your Book Display Widgets. It’s pretty easy. Interested?
