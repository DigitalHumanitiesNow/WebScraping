 Itâs hard to imagine, but thereâs only four weeks of spring semester left at Concordia College. Continuing my reflection series on my course Word to the Wise: Writing for Religious & Social Change, this post considers my approach to assignments and, more specifically, what students have had to say about the assignments they’ve selected and completedÂ so far. In the spirit of creativity and non-traditional forms of academic writing, the main writing assignments for the course fall into two categories: Digital Writing Assignments and Exploration Writing Assignments. In each category I list ten possible options and students select five from each category on which to write. The assignment descriptions tend to be quite short, open-ended, and meant to spur creative questions and responses. Popular Digital Writing Assignment selections include: Write a post reflecting on a time you changed your mind. Write a list, BuzzFeed Style. Share it via social media. Write a post that responds to a class reading. Most, if not all, students completed the three prompts above and posted them on their blogs. However, the options below proved quite unpopular. In a very informal discussion with students, we talked through some of the reasons why. Iâve included those in the bullets below the assignment: Record and post a video of yourself. The videoâs opening words must be, âSo, one time in my religion classâ¦â Students shared that they think videos are awkward Students questions their skill in making a video Students indicated feeling more intimidated about this option than others Write a post that responds to your experiences at your service learning site. Students suggested that while they are processing their experiences internally and with friends, they donât feel comfortable doing so in a public setting (their blog) Students (rightfully) raised questions of confidentially and privacy Write a post that begins with the words, âAt Concordia College, the theme of the core curriculum declares we are âbecoming responsibility engaged in the world,â however, in the case of ________, we fall short.â Several students explained this idea is intriguing to them, but theyâve just put it off untilÂ last. The prompt was less compelling to some because they naturally think about the question often. Students hesitated, or indicated the danger, in publicly critiquing the institution at which they are currently a student. The responses highlight aspects of the Concordia learning community, deficiencies in my course design and instruction, and the daily challenges of teaching and learning. For example, I clearly could have better prepared students for the video blog option by including a handout, sharing an example of my own, or even sharing a YouTube video on how to make a video for WordPress and/or YouTube. In actuality, all but one of the students has the technology to do this on their smartphones they bring to class every day, but I have not adequately prepared students to use the technology for class. Relatedly, I also wonder if students have subtly come to understand video blogs/responses as somehow non-academic. Iâve offered similar assignments in classes in previous semesters, but itâs fairly rare that students post a video. I wonder how I might spur my colleagues to offer similar assignments so that my courses werenât the outliers. (Granted, it could just be a really bad idea, but I submit that college students today should know how to communicate clearly and effectively in short videos.) Both the video option and the critiquing Concordia option also include some degree of risk. In the case of the video, there might be perceived risk in seeing oneâs face on a screen and/or in testing a new technology. In the case of the Concordia critique option, thereâs certainly risk in publicly sharing what some might see as negative insight about the college. One way to counteract this latter issue might be for faculty to model thoughtful, outspoken critique more often. While faculty and staff certainly critique our beloved workplace in closed-door meetings, in formal memos, and over drinks at the bar, we rarely do so publicly. This practice, therefore, doesnât exactly give students much insight in how one might critique their own institution. In keeping things so quiet, faculty might actually be doing students a disservice even as we try to spare them. Since the class is still going on, I havenât had any formal feedback of how these writing assignments have struck students. I also acknowledge that, even in their informal feedback, I put them in what might have been a difficult situation to share openly. Iâll then withhold my final judgment on the success of the select-five-of-ten assignments. Thus far, however, I can report theyâre fun to grade, and that is no small victory.
