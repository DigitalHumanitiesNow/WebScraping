Boaz Lotan Boyd saw the blizzard coming and knew it was time for him to enter this world. At 4PM on Monday, January 26, a little ball of fuzzy cuteness let out a yelp and announced his presence at a healthy 6 pounds 14 ounces. We are now snuggling in the hospital as the world outside gets blanketed with snow.  I’ll be on parental leave for a bit, but I don’t know exactly what that means. What I do know is that I will prioritize existing collaborations and my amazing team at Data & Society. Please be patient as my family bonds and we get our bearings.  Time is the hardest resource to manufacture so please understand that I will probably not be particularly responsive for a while.
