ELO-DHSI Summer Courses (6/1-5; 6/8-12; 6/15-19 2015) We are pleased to announce that the Electronic Literature Organization (ELO) will be partnering with theÂ Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI) to offer opportunities for members to participate in the series of DH courses at the University of Victoria that takes place from June 1st-5th 2015, June 8th-12th 2015, and June 15th-19th 2015. Registration for DHSI is now open. This year will see an expansion from the regular one-week Institute to three weeks of courses, in part to support those enrolled in the Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities at U Victoria. Participants may choose to attend one, two, or all three week-long workshops. In 2015, 40 courses ranging from old favourites to exciting first-time ventures will be offered. Each week of DHSI will include a week-long training workshop, and the core week (June 8th-12th) will also include morning colloquia, lunchtime unconferences, and Birds-of-a-Feather sessions. Throughout the institute, keynote lectures will be given by Malte Rehbein (U Passau), David Hoover (NYU), Claire Warwick (UC London), and Constance Crompton (UBC Okanagan).  ELO representatives will be teaching two courses at DHSI 2015: âIntroduction to Electronic Literature in DH: Research and Practiceâ and âAdvanced Criticism and Authoring of Electronic Literature.â Tuition scholarships are available for students, and ELO members can register at a discounted cost of $300.00 for students and $650.00 for non-students (for registration before April 1st 2015; use discount code ELO-Student or ELO-Non-Student).
