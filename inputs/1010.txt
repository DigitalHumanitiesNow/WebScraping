I'm definitely looking forward to the release of if:book's WordPress plugin Commentpress. if:book has used a nice, sophisticated system that allows for rich user comments on a paragraph-level, using WordPress as a CMS. They've used the system on a few of their projects, including The Iraq Study Group Report and The Future of Learning Institutions in a Digital Age.   *[CMS]: Content Management System
