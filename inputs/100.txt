 I neglected to post a link to this last week, but I thought some of you might still be interested inÂ an article on the InternetÂ even if it is almost one whole week old. Sample:  This is where the inherent tension in the contemporary long take comes from: The director forgoes conventional editing to telegraph intended meaning, instead employing a technique that urges the audience to consider the subject of the shot to be increasingly meaningful. The long take also allows directors to use the standard magicianâs ruse of having ânothing up his sleeve,â because the absence of cuts appears to indicate that there is neither time nor opportunity to insert special effects in a shot. Obviously this isnât true â everyone unfortunately remembersÂ CloverfieldÂ â but the suggestion persists that a long take canât be manipulated because some things canât be faked in real-time. Which is why itâs interesting that the opening shot ofÂ BirdmanÂ â before the ASL has even been established â consists of Riggan (Michael Keaton) performing the oldest trick in the magicianâs handbook:Â levitation.
