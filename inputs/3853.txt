One of the biggest issues facing the more than 8,000 farmers markets across the United States doesn’t concern fruit and vegetables. Instead, it’s the data – or lack thereof.  	Farmers Market Coalition – a national nonprofit working to improve the skills of farmers market managers – says there just aren’t enough people taking advantage of the data that is available. The nonprofit has 900 members from around the country that represent about 5,000 farmers markets. The organization received $35,000 from the Knight Prototype Fund in 2013 to help develop “Market Metrics,” a platform that makes data collection easier for market managers.
