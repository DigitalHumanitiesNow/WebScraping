Kristine Brorson at Historiological Notes pointed out a nice article entitled Girls' Gadgets of the 1920's & 30's, which features Kodak cameras marketed to women in the 1920s and 1930s. A larger website featuring a number of early 20th-century cameras is at Gloriously Colorful Kodaks.  On the same subject, Duke University Libraries has a nice database, called Emergence of Advertising in America, which has a section on Kodak Advertising. One of my favorite ads is the "Anywhere--Everywhere" ad, below, which Kodak ran in 1920. Mike O'Malley uses this ad in one of his History 120 modules, Understanding Advertising. Marketing cameras to women based on their design seems interesting, especially in light of my post yesterday on gender and web design.
