 LCM:Â Does nostalgia play a role in your work? MD:Â I try to be historic rather than nostalgic. For me, nostalgia is always tied to the notion of the âGolden Ageâ of things â this idea that the past was much better. I donât think thatâs true for many things I care about. For women, people of color, gay people, working people, itâs absolutely better now. So I really try to steer clear of golden age thinking and use things to provoke a sense of time and perhaps a sense of loss, but never a sense that somehow our values are worse than the values in the past. I donât think thatâs true. If thereâs any reason for optimism, it is that there has slowly been more access to power for more people.  from this Hyperallergic interview
