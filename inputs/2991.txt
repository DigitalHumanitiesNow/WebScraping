realityshifting:  Taking Wearable Technology on Tour Reality-Shifting Comments: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Little Bootsâalso known as Victoria Hesketâis a pop artist from the UK who has recently taken a different approach to wearable technology. Hesket wanted to create something that would blow her fans away during her encore performances for her upcoming tour. In order to do this, the artist had a dress developed to use during her tour for her second album entitled, Nocturnes.Â  What makes this dress stand out from other fashion statements is the fact that Little Boots wanted the dress to light up and change colours and patterns in concordance with the music being played. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The programming for the dress is written onto an SD card which is placed inside an SD card reader which acts as the brain of the dress. The card tells the dress what it should be doing during each song. The dress is programmed to change in order to match the mood, pace, and themes of the music. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  This is an interesting development in wearable technology because it demonstrates the diversity of the industry. Wearable technology isnât necessarily just for everyday life, it can also be used for entertainment purposes on a large scale. While Little Boots is one of the first people to incorporate wearable technology into her concerts, it is entirely possible that this could soon be a trend. It seems the future of wearable technology is constantly changing shape!
