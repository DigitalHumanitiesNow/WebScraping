The Leipzig Open Fragmentary Texts Series (LOFTS) is a new collaborative project that seeks to create open electronic editions of ancient works that survive only through quotations and text re-uses in later texts. The large diversity and dispersion of these materials entreats a dynamic infrastructure which fully supports and represents the relationships between sources, citations and annotations. LOFTS links fragments to the source text from which they are drawn, and aligns them to multiple editions and translations, thus providing an enhanced understanding of the fragmentary textual heritage it showcases.
