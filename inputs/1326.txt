I’ve written a short piece about the Tapestry conference for theÂ Graphically Speaking column inÂ Computer Graphics and Applications. The article talks about the reasoning behind Tapestry, how it’s different from academic conferences, and gives a few examples of talks. It even includesÂ anecdotal evidence to show that theÂ conference has enabled actualÂ knowledge transfer. If you prefer a PDF to the e-reader version, you can find that on my vanity website.
