It’s quiet here but noisy in my head.  I’ve eviscerated one chapter of my manuscript, which then collapsed under its own weight.  And I’m trying to make the intro the best it can be.  Intense.  I have temporarily suspended my sabbatical “work no more than 40 hours in a week” rule to write a bit on weekends, but I’ll make it up with fun stuff in April.   Also, it’s really good that it took us until March to discover a really good ice cream place in town.
