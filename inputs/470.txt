A nice set of notes here: The Right Way to Do Lean Research, curated from a discussion panel of several folks who really know their stuff: Christina Wodtke, Laura Klein, Todd Zaki-Warfel, and Mike Long.  Right questions: Ask the right questions and save a tremendous amount of time by knowing what you want to learn before doing research. Right people: Talk to the right people about your product: the people would actually pay for it. Right test: The research method you choose depends on what you want to learn and where you are in the product development process. Right place: You try to put yourself in the right place to do the best research on the budget you have…whether you’re in or out of the office. Right attitude: Having the right attitude when doing research is extremely important…are you really in a listening mode or are you selling? Right documentation: Doing a bunch of research is valuable but you can quickly lose important insights if you don’t record everything well. FYI: I’m writing a new book on how to communicate your product or service called Make them Care!. If you would like to be reminded when it comes out, sign up here.
