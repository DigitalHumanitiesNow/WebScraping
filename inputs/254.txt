This summer I have the great privilege to serve as “faculty” at the Teaching Excellence Summer Institute at Assumption College in Worchester, Massachusetts. The institute is directed by Assumption’s James Lang and Sarah Cavanagh. You may know James Lang from his excellent books, On Course and Cheating Lessons (the latter reviewed here on the blog in 2013), or his “On Teaching” column in the Chronicle of Higher Education. I met Jim way back in 2008, when he visited the Vanderbilt campus and I interviewed him for the Center for Teaching’s brand new podcast. (He’s featured in Episode 5!) I’ve been following Jim’s work ever since, and I’ve been particularly impressed by the way he helps faculty develop teaching practices informed by the scholarly literature on teaching and learning. (I haven’t met Sarah, but I’m sure she’s fantastic, too!) The summer institute, scheduled for June 23-25, 2015, should be a transformative experience for faculty or grad students interested in teaching. From the institute’s website: The Institute for Teaching Excellence at Assumption College offers new and early-career college faculty the opportunity to familiarize themselves with key ideas from the literature of human learning, design courses that motivate students and foster deep learning, and develop practical skills and strategies for classroom practice, assessment design, and self-evaluation.Â  Participants in the workshop will be prepared to teach their first college course, or to revise their existing courses, in alignment with findings from the most current research on teaching and learning in higher education. Faculty at the institute include James Lang, Professor of English and Director of the Center for Teaching Excellence at Assumption; Sarah Cavanagh, Assistant Professor of Psychology at Assumption; Andrew Kaufman, Lecturer in Slavic Languages and Literature at the University of Virginia; and me, Director of the Center for Teaching at Vanderbilt University. Jim will bring the learning science, Sarah the student motivation, Andrew the community-engaged teaching, and me, well, I’ll bring the educational technology. I’m really looking forward to learning from these talented scholars and teachers. If this sounds like something that might be of interest to future or current faculty you know, please tell them about the summer institute.Â  The registration fee is $750 before the early-bird deadline of May 1st, with discounts available for grad students and adjunct faculty.Â  More information is available at the instituteâs website.
