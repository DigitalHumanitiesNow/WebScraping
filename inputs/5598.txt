For more than a decade, Georgia State University has focused intensively on improving the retention and graduation rates of students with long odds of succeeding. The results of this effort are truly remarkable. Â  Between 2003 and 2014, GSUâs six-year graduation rate increased by nearly 70 percent, from 32 percent to 54 percent. Â During the same period, the share of its undergraduate population eligible for Pell grants has increased by nearly 90 percent, from 31 percent to 58 percent. Â
