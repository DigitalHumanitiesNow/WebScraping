One of the wonderful features of Mary’s newest game, MONARCH, is its unique and breathtaking art style.  Artist Kate Adams is responsible for the game’s illustrations, and achieves this fantastic look by scratching into scratchboard with blades, as shown in this video!  After scratching, scanning, and coloring, the finished product comes out looking like this:  We’re really excited for MONARCH! Check out more of the finished art over at the Kickstarter page. The campaign is funding until March 14th, and Mary needs your help to make the game a reality!
