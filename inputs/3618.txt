Finally, I got a good shot of my favourite sign.  In the background, you can see that St-Denis, normally a very busy thoroughfare, has been cleared.  Also, some great costumes from tonight’s protest, AND a May 1st flashback for the Tax Dodgers at the NYC May Day demonstration.  They also sang, but I didn’t record.
