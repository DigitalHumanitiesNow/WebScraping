The  goal of the project is to create a web site that weaves together the  journals of the participants into a picture that answers the question,  âJust what do computing humanists really do?â Participants will document  their day through photographs and commentary in a blog-like journal.  The collection of these journals with links, tags, and comments will  make up the final work which will be published online."Over 151 participants have signed up so far!Another project that day is the "How do you define Humanities Computing / Digital Humanities?"  Participants are invited to share their conceptions of the Digital Humanities.  There are some 2011 entries already on the site.  You can see the 2009 and 2010 responses as well.
