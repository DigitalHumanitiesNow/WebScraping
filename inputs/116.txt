 COP:Â Have you noticed anything unusual this morning? SEK:Â Not to my knowledge. COP:Â Nothing at all? Not even aâ¦suspicious dump truck?    SEK:Â A suspicious dump truck? Iâve seen a lot of dump trucks across the street, at the construction site, but I donât know what would make one suspicious. COP:Â You know, like one that didnât look like itâ¦belonged with the other dump trucks. SEK:Â Sorry, they look like a happy little dump truck family to me. COP:Â I understand. Just keep your eyes peeled, and call me if you see anything suspicious. SEK:Â Will do.
