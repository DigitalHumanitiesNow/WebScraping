With finals Â and commencement just around the corner — or already finished — our thoughts turn toward summer. Some of us will be teaching summer classes; others may be planning travel. Most of us are likely to be working on projects of various sorts, and preparing classes for the fall term. I’ll be doing some travel, including spending a good part of June in Minnesota for the Collegium Colloquy on Faith and Intellectual Life. I also have one major project: learning WordPress more thoroughly. I’ve found myself in the happy position of running a large multisite installation of WordPress, and I’ve come to the conclusion that having a solid grasp, not only of how to use WordPress effectively, but also of how it works “under the hood,” will serve me well. Running a small multisite installation on my own domain is one thing; maintaining a large installation for a significant user base is something else again, and I’ll feel more confident about it with a better understanding of WordPress’s inner workings. What are your plans for the summer? Travel? Conferences? Writing? Research? Learning something new? Let us know in the comments.   [Creative Commons licensed image by Matt Christenson for Oregon's Bureau of Land Management]
