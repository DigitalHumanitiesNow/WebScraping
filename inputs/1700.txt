PressForward, the Google Reader replacement that runs inside your WordPress install, is now in open beta! This is one of the project’s that I’ve spent the last year working on and I’m very excited to get to this stage. PressForward, which is hitting beta just in time to complete testing when Google Reader hits the off-button, is a totally open source tool built to run inside WordPress with no extra requirements, server modifications, or messing about in the command line. The system isÂ both an RSS reader and an editorial tool, allowing groups to look at feeds together, discuss them, and nominate them for consideration as part of an aggregation process. You can read all about it at the PressForward website. Here’s a fresh ZIP file of our latest beta version, ready for upload and testing in your WordPress install. Here’s the issue forum to report all the bugs you encounter, so that we can fix them. Give it a try and tell me how it goes! You can download it from GitHub to install on your own WordPress site (FTP access required). Instructions for use are found in a Wiki on GitHub. User support will be in a public Google Group. The PressForward Plugin was developed for the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University by Aram Zucker-Scharff, Boone B. Gorges, and Jeremy Boggs. It is free to use and modify under a GNU GPL2 license. Oh, and more thanks also to:Â @joanftroyano,Â @jeriwieringaÂ andÂ @SashaCA2.
