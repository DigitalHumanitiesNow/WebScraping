  Elizabeth Eisenstein, Professor Emerita of History at the University of Michigan, speaking for the “Books and Beyond” series at the Library of Congress, on the subject of her recent book, Divine Art, Infernal Machine: The Reception of Printing in the West from First Impressions to the Sense of an Ending (Philadelphia: The University of Pennsylvania Press, 2011).  I just learned of this series of webcasts through the sometimes bewildering but not quite endless metonymy of the web.  Highly recommended.
