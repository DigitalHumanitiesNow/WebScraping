 The first year is the hardest. This is a familiar warning, and one that I’ve personally found applies in many academic endeavors: college, graduate school, a new job, a new administrative role. This year was my first year at the University of Central Florida, a move that brought with it many transitions, including a new state, house, job, and program, not to mention new students and colleagues. Over the last year I’ve written about finding a home, preparing to move, leaving campus tech services, settling in, and restarting the tenure process. Looking back, here are a few of the things I found most useful for handling the first year (including a few that I offer in retrospect, from my own mistakes.)  Settle in before the year starts. The academic calendar often means we move in a hurry, without too much time to acclimate before things get moving. Don’t expect too much from your home activity in the first months or maybe even the first year. The best investment I made was to spend a solid week outfitting every main area of my home until it was comfortable and prepared for both work and rest. It makes a huge difference to come home at the end of the day and not be surrounded by household projects and unpacked boxes.   Anticipate fundamental needs. My first day in the house the air conditioning died, a problem both common and dire in Florida in August. I spent faculty orientation week trying to find an air conditioning service specialist in frantic phone calls between meetings. On the home front, I’ve spent much of the year in similar triage: I didn’t have a plumber, dentist, doctor, or anyone else lined up toÂ  call until a problem arose. So, here’s what I’m doing now (and what I wish I’d done earlier): I’ve made a list of all the main names and services from my Maryland address book, and now I’m rebuilding the Maryland version. Angie’s List and other referral services can be a great way to get started if you don’t have trusted recommendations.   Try (cautiously) saying yes. Tenure track professors in particular get reminded to say ânoâ a lot, and that’s certainly an important skill to develop for handling time and workload. However, I found that the first year at a new campus was much more about saying âyesâ even when overwhelmed. Transitioning into a new environment is full of opportunities and unmarked hazards, but your new collaborators can be your best resource.   Embrace a (digital) clean slate. I migrated all of my files from my prior employment to cloud storage and an external hard drive. While I do occasionally reference them to take ideas from my past syllabi or draw on an old reference, most of the time I’ve found I haven’t needed them. This has given me a chance to get my digital life in order for a new context, and rethink my file structures and organization.
