The UK National Archives have a nice site called Learning Curve: Crime and Punishment, which provides classroom materials and primary sources on the historical contexts of committing crime, preventing crime, and punishing perpetrators from before 1450 to the 20th century.   The design is a little clunky but easy to navigate. (Hat tip to Paperholic.)
