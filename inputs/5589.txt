I am a pretty disturbed by the media focus on the Middle East conflict, and unbalanced descriptions of the conflict. More importantly, I am mortified by the recent commitment from Western nations to conduct bombings and warfare in Iraq and Syria. Years ago, similar arguments were made about intervening with Afghanistan and Iraq. Two years after the 9/11 attacks, Newsgaming.com released a game called “September 12″. âThe basic idea behind âSeptember 12thâ can be described as âviolence generates more violenceâ. As you try to kill the terrorists, you will always kill civilians (‘collateral damage’). Other civilians will mourn their dead and turn into terrorists. After a couple of minutes of play, the screen is full of terrorists.â It is wrong and naive to think that missile strikes and bombings are a solution to the old conflict or this new situation. Play the game, and try to remember that we’ve been here before, and it still hasn’t ended.
