I turned my doctoral research seminar paper in today. As I've expressed previously, I don't plan to pursue the topic for my dissertation. But I think it's a good paper, and I plan to work on it a little more and either publish in here on my site or send it to a journal. The paper, entitled "In Close Proximity: Race, Naturalism, and Law in Virginia, 1900s-1920s," explores the inherent contradictions seeing white supremacy as a fact of nature and having to codify and enforce that superiority through law.  In the meantime, I'm working on a review of the electronic journal DigitalMedievalist.org (not to be confused with Digital Medievalist: Scela), which appears to have some good things going on. Other potential reviews of websites, books, movies, and articles are in the works. Hopefully I'll have the DigitalMedievalist review up by tomorrow.
