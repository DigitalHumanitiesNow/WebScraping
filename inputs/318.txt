The Map of Early Modern LondonÂ is a GIS project developed by the University of Victoria, which allows users to explore the spaces and places that constituted early modern London, following Ralph Agasâ map of 1561. Information is layered onto the map, drawing from several combinable databases curated within the site, and it can be used to understand how spatiality shaped the writings of the period. The director of the project, Janelle Jenstad,Â claimsÂ that MoEML allows users to think of Early Modern London as we think of our own cities nowadays, through the use of tools such as Google Maps. The project definitely addresses a growing interest in the role of space, which, as David Bodenhamer mentions in his article âCreating a Ladscape of Memory: The Potential of Humanities GISâ, wasÂ largely overlookedÂ by humanists until the last few decades.The site comprises four interconnected projects: the aforementioned Agas map, on which aÂ gazeteerÂ is also based; a Library with a large amount of early modern texts, relevant because of their abundance in London toponyms; an EncyclopediaÂ of early Londoners, as well as of places, terms and topics of the times; and a forthcoming updated edition of John Stowâs A Survey of London. All of these elements add layers of interesting data, but the map remains at the heart of the project. This is the reason why the project can beÂ a bit of a let-down. Agaâs map is divided into several zoomable sections. When selecting one of the squares, the screen shows places marked by stars: the red stars point to places with their own entry in the encyclopedia, whereas the yellow stars point to places that still donât have one (and the MoEML welcomes contributions from knowledgeable authors to fill in these gaps, in case you’re an expert!). There is a drop-down menu above the selected square that allows you to decide what kind of place youâd like to see on the map: from playhouses, to gates, to markets. This is an interesting feature, which has led me to “discover” something that will by no means come as a surprise: you’d be hard-pressed to find a library in 1560 London, but churches were everywhere! The black-and-grey format of the map, while an understandable choice, doesnât quite bring the city to life for a contemporary user who is accustomed to visualize cities in colourful 3D formats.Another shortcoming of MoEML is that clicking on one of the stars leads you to that place’s encyclopedia entry. Bodenhamer considers that the power of GIS lies in the fact that all kinds of data can be visualized on the map itself, a sentiment that is echoed in Gregory and Cooperâs âGIS, Texts, and Imagesâ. Even thoughÂ MoEMLÂ makes a lot of interesting information available, the interface doesnât allow for an integrated visualization, which hinders the exploratory side of the project by making the map seem little more than a repository of hyperlinks.However, the project is not presented as a finished product, and the navigation/interface limitations donât detract too much from the high-quality content.
