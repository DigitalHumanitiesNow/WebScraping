Crowdsourcing Metadata as well as transcription at the Bodleian: Iâm curious how this will play out - funded by Google, a digitization program for which the second stage seems to be âbuild a crowd-source community interface, hope lots of people enter accurate metadata for sheet music because we made it available.â Â Iâm skeptical, as while it might generate basic metadata, itâs not going to do the kind of detailed cataloging still required for manuscripts (medieval or otherwise). Â The BL, for all of my frustrations with their online medieval mss catalogues, are improving both the scholarship and the digital access to that scholarship at the same time. Â Itâs a shame, but the Bodleian (a beloved space for me) is well short of where it might have been.
