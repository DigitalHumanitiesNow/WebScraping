Well, I’d planned to blog a whole lot more but the last couple weeks have been surprisingly busy, which is good, since it’s not much fun to contemplate the countdown to surgery.  More musings, possibly deranged (but don’t get your hopes up), will be forthcoming when I get home from tomorrow’s surgery.  Carrie will post an update in this space when there is one.   In the meantime, I have become quite concerned about the lack of visibility of thyroid cancer in the stuffed animal world.  As you may know, breast cancer has an enduring association with teddy bears.  So, in the interest of promoting thyroid cancer stuffed animal awareness, I give you the thyroid cancer hedgehog.
