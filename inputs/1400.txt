I have resisted for now a few years without blogging, but it seems that these days it is a quite mandatory to have one, so here I am!I think I will experiment by blogging different stages of my work. Being a Digital Humanist sometimes it takes a lot of time before you can produce something that it is wort publishing, so a blog seems the best place where to share ideas and works in progress.A warning to those that might be tempted to follow me in this adventure: how knows me knows also that I compensate my imperfect English grammar with my natural Latin exuberance. Unfortunately  Latin exuberance is more difficult to appreciate in written than it is in person, so be prepared to bare my grammar...
