Instead of having interesting outside links on the right side of my weblog, I'm going to start doing what others are doing. I'm putting my outside links in my blog, as an entry in and of itself. I've been tired of the sidebar for a while and, like Dan at SimpleBits, the workarounds for using the title attribute for descriptions of links got kinda weird. Besides, putting the links in a post themselves makes them more prominent, and indirectly motivates me to actually find and read other stuff out there.
