The more I worked, the angrier I got at the white suffragists who excised from their history the black women who had stood beside them advocating for the vote.  Susan B. Anthony inscribed to Adella Logan Hunt a copy of the very volume that makes no mention of black women's efforts?Is this not what digital history can do best?  Is the Black Woman Suffrage database, already a corrective to History of Woman Suffrage, not the perfect place to assemble a one?Searching the 904 files for any that contained rights or suffrage yielded 282 items.  To parallel the History of Woman Suffrage meant only using items up to 1920, leaving 227.The table of contents for my volume begins with Maria Stewart's 1832 stirring speech "Cause for Encouragement" published in The Liberator and runs through excerpts from the National Association of Colored Women's Association Meeting Notes.A skim of the list of contributing publications revels not only The Liberator and other abolitionist publications, but like the National Association of Colored Women's Association Meeting Notes, consists of others by and for black women,  such as The Women's Era, the first monthly newspaper published by African-American women, Josephine St Pierre Ruffin.And among the most frequent contributors are names less familiar that Sojourner Truth or Ida B. Wells, such as  Mary Ann Shadd Cary, Fannie Barrier Williams, Rosalie M. Jonas, and Victoria Earle Matthews.What if I'd had their writings, alongside those of the almost exclusively white suffragists compiled in the History of Woman Suffrage. What sort of discourse of rights and suffrage might emerge?  How would gender appear?While my research contract precludes me from assembling the History of Black Woman Suffrage, below you can see the table of contents.
