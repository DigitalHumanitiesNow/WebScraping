A couple of weeks ago I wrote about the game I made as an experiment [1] in how to handle gameplay and historic material. One of the issues I struggled with was that women, historically, have had limited or no agency at a societal level. The fundamental design issue underlying my experiment was that narrative, mechanics and player agency ALL communicate meaning in a game. I know that the design must take all of these factors into account in order to deliver deep and more meaningful game play. What happens when a game misses that mark? Well, Mission US: Flight to Freedom[2] is a good example. An NEH funded series of games that allow players to experience history from the perspectives of different cultural groups such as a white apprentice boy in Boston, a Northern Cheyenne boy and a Jewish immigrant, it has been around for a couple of years and has garnered considerable praise. Until yesterday, when Rafranz Davis posted an impassioned blog discussing why this game was offensive [3]. Itâs safe to say that the makers of this game had nothing but good intentions, so what went wrong? The answer is pretty straightforward. The mechanics of the game are in opposition to a critically important thematic understanding of slavery. Rafranz Davis hits the nail on the head when she notes that, âYes, Lucyâ¦youâll get a beating and itâs not because you are a slave who is owned by an evil slave ownerâ¦but because you chose the wrong pathâ¦thus, consequences.â [3] Interestingly, this game carries the name of an earlier, more scholarly approach created at Bowdoin College [4] a number of years ago in which players take on the role of a slave trying to escape to Canada. All of the events and options were taken from authentic slave narratives in what was a more distanced, resource management approach. Caleb McDaniel introduces a discussion between the two games and quotes from the then ongoing Assassinâs Creed slavery game debate and the ethics of âplaying the powerlessâ:What are the limits of playing the powerless? What is lost and what is gained in portrayingâand playingâa situation that has been well represented in other media? And what considerations should developers and players alike have with regards to responsibility and accountability? [5]Davis also wonders why on earth anyone would simulate such a painful subject. I think the answer to that is that the developers and educators felt that players could fully comprehend the situation faced by real people by âwalking a mile in their shoes.â By and large this approach seems to have, at least superficially, hit the mark: âIt's not only an engaging video game, it's a harrowing, illuminating look at the realities of life as an American slave.â [6] However, for those concerned with the nuances of racism and historic interpretation, thereâs a big problem with the underlying thematic content that players absorb, many without even realizing it: It reinforces the idea that black people are somehow innately âslave-ishâ versus illuminating the fact that white slave owners did this for a reason, and that the society benefiting from this brutality created elaborate legal, social and moral codes to justify it, including stereotypes that remain with us to this very day.[3]As a woman, I appreciate the ability games have to express the powerlessness I feel towards systemic misogyny. However, I wouldnât want that exploited as a cheap way to thrill and titillate as a means to create educational engagement. And Iâm afraid thatâs what happened here. Iâm not sure what a slave role playing game should look like. I am sure, though, that designers and scholars should spend many hours discussing what the big thematic message from the game play should be prior to tackling the educational goals. Everything that the player encounters and does must re enforce that primary message. In the case of Mission US: Flight to Freedom, Iâm not sure what that would be. However, there are interesting ideas presented in Davis' post that focus on contextualizing slavery and its economic importance in US history. Instead of playing a slave, why not play an abolitionist who could better explore the political, social and economic complexities of the time? Additionally, history games face the question of perspective, that is, whose truth to privilege? As Du Vernay stated when defending the âhistorical inaccuraciesâ of Selma:According to Diane Nash, John Lewis, Andrew Young and the people on the ground who were there -- the citizens of Selma -- that's not their truth, but history is for each of us to interpret for ourselves, so anyone's opinion is valid, truly it is. [7]These issues are being faced by museums, educators, filmmakers and writers for all media and there are a number of approaches that might be taken. However it is clear that they are more problematic for games because harnessing interactivity is still in the early stages. The very nature of interacting with a narrative changes interpretation and connection that goes beyond any digital platform [8]. Interactivity changes our relationship with content; we think about it and approach it differently from traditional (linear) narratives. It is clear to me that much more research and discussion needs to happen between scholars and game makers â not in the throes of developing a game â but at a theoretical level about how interactivity and its design impact scholarship and communication.Works Cited[1]          âThe Goblin Market: An Experiment in Serious Game Design | Lost Worlds: Explorations in Digital Humanities Game Design.â .[2]          âMission US | THIRTEEN.â [Online].
