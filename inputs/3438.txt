A new generation of small video cameras and consumer robotic helicopters make amazing video shots possible. Stick your phone on a drone for enchanting views of the natural world, architecture, museums, and more. Here’s a cool new video flying a drone around the NY public library: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9FMlv5a_FI  That was shot byÂ Nate Bolt with a DJI Phantom quad-copterÂ and both a GoPro Hero3 Black and an iPhone 5S. Slowed down with Twixtor in After Effects to make up for the glaring lack of a Gimbal. A stunning video taken over Niagara Falls this past summer with the same helicopter (watch this one full-screen): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfoLYTKObiU Not as lovely, here’s an example of flyingÂ the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial Gateway Arch and the Museum Court house in St. Louis with a turbo Ace X830 helicopter. This has potential, but the blades hurt the effect. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP62Bk-ydRo Inside theÂ Australian Museum is a charming, short view of the collection from Journeys to the Deep. However, the shots are shaky. The stabilization methods used in the above library example are important. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnR0tGpGJmw Drone regulations vary by locality, but is generally legal within height and distance limits from the operator. Not only are the results a fresh view of scenes, lending an appealing aerial perspective, but audiences are now used to complex camera shots on television and film, so Â step up your game with your visuals.
