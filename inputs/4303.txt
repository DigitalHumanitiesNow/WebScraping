I just finished this CityEngine webscene showing changes in the Roman Forum between 160 BC and 44 BC.Â The scene is part of the RomeLab project and will also soon be available in Unity Web Player. The scene includes buildings generated with my Roman City ruleset. The temples, basilicas, porticos, curia, domus, and streets were all modeled procedurally, making use of attributes to adapt the buildings to their different phases.Â The Tabularium model (the only non-procedural building) is from the UCLA Digital Roman Forum project. Parameter values and other data are visible by clicking on a building.
