Hi all, I'm looking for researchers/enthusiasts of the digital humanities to participate in a survey evaluating a digital humanities thesaurus.   The survey is here: http://goo.gl/forms/DyKllxSLMC  and the thesaurus is here: http://dhthesaurus.com/  The survey should only take about 15-20 minutes and I would greatly value your input and feedback. If you leave your email at the end of the survey, you'll be entered in a drawing to win a $5 Starbuck gift card. Thanks!
