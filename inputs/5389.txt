Event DetailsAs article-level metrics (ALM) come of age, the question is no longer whether we need them, but rather how we implement them. Building upon the successful ALM Workshop in November 2012, PLOS invites you to the second annual ALM Workshop 2013 on October 10-12, 2013 in San Francisco.The preliminary program is [now] ... posted ... .  Check out the lineup of speakers and presentations in store for the event, representing researchers; funders; academic administrators; and technology providers.[http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/alm-workshop-2013-preliminary-program/]This year, we will move the community conversations beyond the basics to focus on success stories and challenges encountered, latest analyses on the growing data corpus, as well as deep dives into the technical details behind it all. The format in the first two days will consist of a series of talks and panel discussions with ample mingling time to encourage in-depth sharing. For the third day of the workshop, we will organize a data challenge (data hackathon), giving participants the opportunity to do data analysis and data visualization on a variety of ALM datasets from different sources.*** FREE Registration ***Please register for the data challenge [at][http://almdatachallenge.eventbrite.com/]                                        Source and Links Available At:[http://almworkshop13.eventbrite.com/]
