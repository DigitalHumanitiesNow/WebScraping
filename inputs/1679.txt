When something doesn't exist (like artificial intelligence) it's easy to think that there is some missing piece of magic required to bring it in to existence. There has been a growing interest in movie depictions of AI of late, and these all seem to require some sort of non-linear step to realize this technology. Ex Machina (which I really enjoyed) required a new sort of hard/software in the form of a jelly like substance. ChappieÂ (which I also liked, though I generally prefer cheese and ham combined in a sandwich) required 'terabytes of coding' and a good amount of luck to produce its AI. Age of Ultron (a film about one liners and explosions) required a magic jewel from Loki's staff no less to create its AI. Transcendence (Kurzweil summarized) gives up on AI and simply loads a human brain into the ether. The message in all of these movies is - the reason we don't have AI is that we haven't taken some non-linear step.
