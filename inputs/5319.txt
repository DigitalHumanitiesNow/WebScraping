Emerson writes in “The Poet,” “So when the soul of the poet has come to ripeness of thought, she detaches and sends away from it its poems or songs,--a fearless, sleepless, deathless progeny, which is not exposed to the accidents of the weary kingdom of time; a fearless, vivacious offspring, clad with wings...”  For Emerson,  as for Derrida, the deconstructive moment gives way to the monstrous birth, a chimera-like creature, born of ideas but with a life of its own, a progeny of poems that weave through the world and into the “hearts of men.”  Until we’ve decided exactly what we’ll do with it, new media is a poem; a web site is a poem; the Kindle is a poem.
