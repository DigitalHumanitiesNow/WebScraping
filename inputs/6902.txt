My essay "A League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" is out today in The New Inquiry's issue 24, "Bloodsport." Since The New Inquiry doesn't take footnotes, I am putting my footnotes here, sans context. Gotta cite those works.Update 1/31/2014: My attention was recently brought to Daniel Goldberg's useful article "Mild Traumatic Brain Injury, the U. S. National Football League, and the Manufacture of Doubt: An Ethical, Legal, and Historical Analysis," which also uses a Geertzian framework for understanding the NFL's management of evidence.Lindsey adds this.1.

The jokeâs on us if we compare football to war. In Stephen Craneâs iconic tale of scrambling toward masculinity, â[h]e ducked his head low like a football player.â Setting aside that the comparison is already anachronisticâAmerican football was a post-Reconstruction Era phenomenonâas Bill Brown, like Geertz, suggests, play is conventionally a structuring metaphor for war rather than the reverse. In 2011, Bennet Omalu would connect CTE, the condition he diagnosed in former Steeler Mike Webster, to post-traumatic stress disorder in military veterans.

In the book, Fainaru-Wada and Fainaru make a strong distinction between Omaluâs reception and McKeeâs; indeed, âBUâs researchers [McKee among them] literally kept a file on what they alleged were Omaluâs exaggerationsâ; in the book, Omalu is widely characterized as prone to overinterpretation (epistemological immodesty). Yet the distinction is also strongly associated with Omaluâs lack of social fitâhis âinappropriateâ inability or unwillingness to modify his academic presentation style for a room full of football players and family members, his lack of investment in football as a cultural phenomenon, and, indeed, his foreignness. âI think [his swift sidelining from scientific discourse was] because heâs a black man, I honestly believe that,â the former linebacker Harry Carson states. âAnd heâs not an American black man; heâs from Africa.â McKee, in contrast, is represented as a nearly ideal figure, âwith blond hair and blue eyes, a Green Bay Packers nut from Appleton, Wisconsin, with a girlish giggle and a knack for making the brain accessible and fun.â Fainaru-Wada and Fainaru, League of Denial, 290â3; 255.14.

It doesnât end there. Vick is unpopular with âcasualâ fans, due to his dogfighting scandal, according to polling, but he is appreciated by âhardcore fansââthose, we might say, who âlove the game.â Tom Van Riper, âThe NFLâs Most-Disliked Players,â Forbes, October 21, 2013, http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomvanriper/2013/10/21/the-nfls-most-disliked-players-2/.16.

Perfettoâs occupation is mentioned in neither the documentary nor the book.

As Perfetto notes, this dementia is often characterized by violent episodes, which are especially dangerous coming from exceptionally large men who are not yet old or even necessarily middle-aged.
