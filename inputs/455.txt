How are terracotta warriors, billiard, a coloring book and the city of Basel all related to each other? Well... they are featured in this week's linkfest:Augmented reality glasses decipher emotional cues from other people, increase emotional intelligence. While other, concept, glasses strive to make those cues more visible (but since it's not AR, it's cheating).Kraft is one conglomerate which is openly skeptical about augmented reality (via @bdwassom).Developers, rejoice! Our old friends at YDreams have released a beta version of YVision, a natural user interface SDK that has computer vision and a physics engine baked into it.HitLab NZ introduces first(?) coloring book that comes to life with a bit of augmented reality.If you are a Layar developer, AR-4-Basel may be the contest for you (via @genebecker).Two years ago I wrote about Deep Green the robotic, augmented reality pool player from Canada. Now a student from Germany created a mini version.Terracotta warriors come alive - not another zombie movie, but rather an AR iPhone game.This week's video is just strange. An augmented reality artwork created by John Goto and Matthew Leach using the Layar platform, Gilt City confronts the banking crisis in an unusual way. Famous beggars appear on your mobile's screen, and you choose whether to help them, or make them explode. Art - I'll never understand it, but maybe you will, by reading more about this project here.Have a grand week!
