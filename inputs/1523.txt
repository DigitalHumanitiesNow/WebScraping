The 2014 meeting of the Alliance will focus on fighting corruption – and the vast illicit outflows generated by corruption – by sharing know-how and experiences in the use of both traditional and alternative corruption fighting approaches.” All financial transactions create a network as one person transfers money from one account to another. Â A list of transactions creates a web of connections with an emergent shape or pattern. Â Within these patterns are key positions occupied by people with special power in the network. Â Mapping these transaction networks can reveal the hidden traces of financial crime.
