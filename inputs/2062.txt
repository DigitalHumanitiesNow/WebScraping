Several research projects at the University of Leuven currently draw         on the interdisciplinary platform Trismegistos (http://www.trismegistos.org), which collects metadata         about Greek, Latin, Egyptian and other ancient texts. For Greek papyri, we use the XML-encoded         full-text corpus of the Duke Database of Documentary Papyri as a basis for data input and analysis.
