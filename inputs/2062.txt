Registration is now open for HILT: Humanities Intensive Learning and Teaching: http://mith.umd.edu/training/Sponsored and run by MITH: Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities, the first instiute was called the Digital Humanities Winter Institute which was run during the second week of January, 2013.  I attended that institute--Humanities Programming--and you can see my posts here.  Participant feedback from the insttute was positive with a request that the institute be moved to a different time of year rather than the beginning of the semester. Consequently, the HILT will be August 4th-8th, 2014 at the University of Maryland, College Park.
