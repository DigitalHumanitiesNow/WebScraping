Thanks to Michael Branson Smith for the great tip to listen to Adam Savage’s talk “Why We Make” at the 2012 San Francisco Maker Fair. Savage explains with some brilliance how art is always part of STEM (art is where it all begins), and how learning works best when it comes through “making what you can’tÂ notÂ make.” This is just an excerpt from the end of the talk, the part most relevant to teaching and learning. TheÂ entire talkÂ is well worth a listen, but for those with limited time, this clip is the heart of it.
