The Internet Archive (IA), an independent non-profit, provides access to digital materials (including books, websites, music, video, TV and software) on the Internet. In this plenary talk from CNI’s recent spring meeting, digital library pioneer and IA founder Brewster Kahle describes the particular challenge of providing open access to modern materials, particularly in light of repeated admonishments by legal advisors that, in doing so, “bad things would happen.” Providing Universal Access to Modern Materials â and Living to Tell the Tale is now available online:  and on Vimeo: https://vimeo.com/125044497 Look for more announcements soon on videos of other sessions from the spring 2015 CNI meeting.
