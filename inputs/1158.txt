ClioWeb hosts the May 1 History Carnival, so send in your post submissions to me by email (jboggs AT gmu DOT edu) or use the submission form at Blog Carnival. I need more nominations, so keep sending them in! And, with Cliopatria's blogroll now sporting over 400 history blogs, I know there must be some great stuff out there!
