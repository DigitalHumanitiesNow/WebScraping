For 3 weeks I am teaching Digital Culture at the University of Bergen. My courses include lessons in game studies and Critical Code Studies. Along the way, I have been collaborating on 2 projects: a locative corpse set in Bergen an improvisational work with Rob Wittig. In the meantime, I have also published a preliminary version Twitter archives of “The Ballad of WorkstudySeth.”   Also, I published “Viva La Revolutions” a ReMix video of versions of “Viva la Vida” mashed with footage of the revolutionary movements in Egypt, Iran, Tunisia, Bahrain, and Libya.
