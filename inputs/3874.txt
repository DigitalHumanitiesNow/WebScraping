So, a semester's work of work comes down to tomorrow.  As I've discussed before, my Women's History since 1870 course has spent the semester researching and creating a classroom from the mid-20th Century.The students in the class spent the first half of the semester working on research in the primary sources of the school, especially those resources in our Special Collections department.  They created the following sites for each decadeSite: 1930sSite: 1940sSite: 1950sSite: 1960sWe then voted on which decade would be the focus of our class re-creation and the 1950s was chosen.  We split into new groups to plan the class session itself.  Student posts on outlines for the various parts of the recreation, including specific advice and instructions for students.Academic Content -- Schedule and description of class activity for Tuesday, including debate and time for discussion of non-academic activitiesActivities -- Outline for how we will work in discussion of non-academic activities on campus.Clothing/materials -- Advice on dress code for 1950s students (General, Men, hair, makeup, accessories), and school supplies.Photo group -- Re-creating various historical photographs.  Pictures to be taken on Thursday, April 25.Student Clubs and ActivitiesClassrooms and formal eventsDorm LifeAcademicsCampus PhotosBased on all that research and the work done by the students, we came up with the following schedule for tomorrow's class, re-creating a 1952 History class: April 17 schedule.I'm looking forward to it.  Wish us luck.
