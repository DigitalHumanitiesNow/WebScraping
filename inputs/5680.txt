Some time ago, I posted an essay on craftsmanship that featured a piece of furniture that my father built.  That essay turned out to be the one of the most popular blog post Iâve written, and it also led to a number of emails expressing admiration for my fatherâs skills as a woodworker.  It is with great pleasure, then, that I post this most recent example of my fatherâs work â a ârace carâ bed for my three-year-old nephew Angus:        Now, Iâm going to guess that most of my readers are over the age of thirty.  But I know what youâre thinking: Can I have a race car bed?
