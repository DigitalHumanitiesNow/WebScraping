I was delighted to be a guest (along with Bill Turkel) on Digital Campus for their 25th episode.  I havenât listened to it yet â and so Iâm not sure to what degree I made a fool of myself â but it was great fun to hang out with Bill, Dan, and Tom.  Digital Campus, of course, is the fantastic podcast put out by The Center for History and New Media at George Mason University.
