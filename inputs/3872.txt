   <blockquote>   <p>I thought it much to be regretted that Richardâs education had not counteracted those [negative] influences or directed his character. He had been eight years at a public school and had learnt, I understood, to make Latin verses of several sorts in the most admirable manner. But I never heard that it had been anybodyâs business to find out what his natural bent was, or where his failings lay, or to adapt any kind of knowledge to <em>him</em>. <em>He</em> had been adapted to the verses and had learnt the art of making them to such perfection that if he remained at school until he was of age, I suppose he could only have gone on making them over and over again unless he had enlarged his education by forgetting how to to it. Still, although I had no doubt that they were very beautiful, and very improving, and very sufficient for a great many purposes in life, and always remembered all through life, I did doubt whether Richard would not have profited by some one studying him a little, instead of him studying them quite so much.</p> </blockquote>  <p>- Charles Dickens, <em>Bleak House</em>, âEstherâs Narrative,â p. 182</p>  <p>Dewey, eat your heart out!</p>    <p><a href="http://kris.shaffermusic.com/2015/03/charles-dickens/">Charles Dickens, critical pedagogue</a> was originally published by Kris Shaffer at <a href="http://kris.shaffermusic.com">Kris Shaffer</a> on March 30, 2015.</p>
