While looking at software relating to digital video earlier today I came across a handy website called alternativeTo. It's a useful means of comparing software applications and getting an idea of the tools that are out there to help perform a particular task. AlternativeTo gives a brief summary of each piece of software along with screenshots of the software in action. Another useful feature is that searches can be filtered by whether the tools are free or open source.
