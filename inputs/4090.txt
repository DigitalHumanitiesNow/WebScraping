The history of American secularism is a mostly neglected field, except a few gems such as James Turnerâs Without God, Without Creed: The Origins of Unbelief in America and Amanda Porterfieldâs Conceived in Doubt: Religion and Politics in the New American Nation. In the most recent issue of The American Scholar, Susan Jacoby offers a treatment of the life of Robert Ingersoll that verges on hagiography, complete with the threat of martyrdom:  His portliness impelled the Oakland Daily Evening Tribune to note that, in another century, the amount of fat in the Great Agnosticâs body would have produced a âspectacular auto da fÃ©.â  As in her book, Freethinkers: A History of American Secularism, Jacoby writes history in the same pattern as her opponents, âthose who wish to recreate the countryâs mythic origins in their own image.â Still, Ingersoll deserves to be better known as an important figure from the nineteenth century, and perhaps Jacobyâs recent biography, The Great Agnostic, will be a contribution. Update: Timothy Larsen reviews Jacobyâs biography, and finds it riddled with errors and misinterpretations (via Alan Jacobs).
