This is just a quick pointer to a post over at Josh Stenger’s blog that organizes media and communication departments at the USN&WR’s top-ranked SLACs (that’s probably too much acronyming). I just added a probably-too-long comment there, so I won’t go into much more detail here. Â (Although its probably worth noting here the limitations of using rankings like this to indicate any kind of relative weight to these programs. Â Still, having the data all in one place is excellent work and useful in itself. Â We can discuss the validity of the ranking system itself another time.) Regardless, very interesting info, indeed.
