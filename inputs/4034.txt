In an earlier post, I shared some maps of Catholic dioceses in the United States, Canada, and Mexico over time. My R-fu has since gotten stronger. In particular, Iâve learned how to use shapefiles. While the R packages ggmaps is good when one wants a physical or street map, itâs not capable of displaying changes in political boundaries, and it forces you to use a square aspect ratio. In these updated maps of Catholic dioceses, Iâve used shapefiles of historic state boundaries from the NHGIS to give a better view of where new dioceses fit into the United States. Iâve also animated the maps rather than display them separately. The data along with the R code for making the maps is available on GitHub. Red dot are the seats of dioceses; purple dots are the seats of archdioceses. The data includes both Roman rite and various eastern rite dioceses. Iâve only displayed dioceses in Mexico and Canada that are close to the border within the boundaries of the map, though the data has all the Canadian and Mexican dioceses.
