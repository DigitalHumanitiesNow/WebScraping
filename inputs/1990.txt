The Europeana network of Ancient Greek and Latin Epigraphy aims to provide historians and the general public with a curated online multi-text edition which has high quality contents and related contents as well as high quality data in multiple interoperable formats. Linked Open Data principles aim at bringing things together so we have tried to follow those guidelines. EAGLE considered two standards: TEI â€“ EpiDoc and CIDOC CRM and we work towards tools to facilitate wilful alignment as well as coordinated linking via third parties annotations or through the alignment to common vocabularies (of contents), gazetteers and bibliographies.
