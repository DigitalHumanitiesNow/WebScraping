For my grad school thesis, I’m investigating an emerging wave of museum initiatives that invite audiences to experiment with new technologies. Among my case studies is the Los Angeles County Museum of Art’s Art + Technology Lab. This program revives the spirit of the original Art & Technology program, an effort led by curator Maurice Tuchman from 1967 to 1971 that placed artists (Andy Warhol, James Turrell, and Claes Oldenburg, to name a few) in residence at tech and engineering companies such as Boeing. In its current incarnation, the A+T Lab invites artists to apply for a grant of up to $50,000, as well as support from the Lab’s partners, to explore artist applications of emerging technologies. Recently, I had the chance to chat with John Craig Freeman about his involvement with the A+T Lab. He’ll be in residence in Los Angeles in the spring to work on his project, EEG AR: Things We Have Lost, which employs both brainwave sensing and augmented reality to make a map the people of L.A in the public sphere. You can read our interview over at LACMA’s blog.
