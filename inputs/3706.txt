American jingoism doesn’t look any better in 2011 than it did in 2001.   I am really having a hard time with people’s enjoyment of revenge. Sure, Obama scored some kind of symbolic military victory, but it is just that.  In America, bin Laden’s relevance has been mostly symbolic for a long time.  He was clearly in retirement and strategically irrelevant to international politics.  I doubt it has made anyone safer, and if we know anything about victim politics, revenge rarely resolves much of anything.
