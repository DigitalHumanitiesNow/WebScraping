In advance of the upcoming "Humanities + Digital Tools" panel discussion, the Stanford Humanities Center has produced a series of videos that detail the different exciting projects, many of which were created with support from or even led by members of the Stanford University Libraries' Center for Interdisciplinary Digital Research (CIDR). Below, I've embedded the videos that feature support from Academic Technology Specialists and Digital Humanities Research Developers, all core members of CIDR. Rather than list the entire team for each project, I have only highlighted the contributions of the CIDR-affiliated members. Please watch the videos (listed in no particular order) to learn more about all the talented individuals who are working on these exciting projects.  Lacuna Stories features Mike Widner, the Academic Technology Specialist for the Division of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages  Palladio featuresÂ Nicole Coleman, the Academic Technology Specialist for the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA) Writing Rights also features Nicole Coleman.  Geography of the Post features Jason Heppler, the Academic Technology Specialist for the Department of History.  ÃatalhÃ¶yÃ¼k Living Archive features Karl Grossner, Digital Humanities Research Developer, and Claudia Engel, Academic Technology Specialist for the Department of Anthropology.
