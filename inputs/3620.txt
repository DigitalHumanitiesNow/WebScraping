This will be my self-reward when I finish all my obligations for the term. For the uninitiated, hereâs the rundown. In Broken Age, players control two characters: Vella, a young girl whoâs about to be sacrificed to an ancient monster called Mog Chothra, and Shay, a teenage boy who was raised in a spaceship by a coddling artificial intelligence called âMom.â At first, the connection between the two characters is thematic, not literal. Instead of peacefully accepting her fate, Vella decides to fight back and kill the monster; meanwhile, Shayâs bored with going on fake, patronizing âmissions,â and decides to rebel against Mom and her mechanical overseers. | Eventually, the two storylines converge when players finally see how the two plots connect, itâs a big âa-ha!â moment, and itâs both fiendishly clever and absolutely hilarious. Broken Age is full of moments like those. —âBroken Ageâ Review.
