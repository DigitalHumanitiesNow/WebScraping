I received this today by email.Â  If 7021 students are interested in the theme, they might double-dip by writing their final paper on this topic. One might think about how print publication “scales up” from other forms of dissemination, for example.Â  Note that proposals are due in approximately five weeks. ——————————————————————————- Below please find the CFP for a graduate-student conference at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor to be heldÂ March 21-22, 2014.  “The Economy of Scales” will be hosted by the Eighteenth-Century Studies Group and the Nineteenth-Century Forum and explores the concept of scale in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  Registration is free, and the deadline for submissions isÂ November 1, 2013.Â For more information, please visit the conference website at  http://www.umich.edu/~ecsg/Conference2014/index.html  Many thanks, Adam Sneed & Aran Ruth adsneed@umich.edu,Â aranruth@umich.edu Coordinators, Eighteenth-Century Studies Group University of Michigan, Ann Arbor  —   Call For Papers: The Economy of Scales March 21-22, 2014 3222 Angell Hall Plenary lectures by Noah Heringman (English, University of Missouri) and Craig Benjamin (History, Grand Valley State University). Eighteenth-Century Studies Group & Nineteenth-Century Forum University of Michigan – Ann Arbor  The eighteenth and nineteenth century witnessed the rise of many new modes of inquiry and practice. Often, these new fields required the development, implementation, and standardization of new scales to accompany these practices. This is most evident in the natural sciences: for example, Dalton’s atomic mass unit revolutionized the field of chemistry, Hutton’s idea of deep time that of geology, Planck units physics, Ampere’s amp and Volta’s volt electromagnetics, and so on. But it also can be said for aesthetic and cultural practices: consider the different âscalesâ organizing ideas of the picturesque and the sublime. At one moment in George Eliotâs Middlemarch, the scientifically-minded narrator pauses to reflect on the critical relation between oneâs scale of inquiry and oneâs interpretive practice:   Even with a microscope directed on a water-drop we find ourselves making interpretations which turn out to be rather coarse; for whereas under a weak lens you may seem to see a creature exhibiting an active voracity into which other smaller creatures actively play as if they were so many animated tax-pennies, a stronger lens reveals to you certain tiniest hairlets which make vortices for these victims while the swallower waits passively at his receipt of custom.   Following Eliotâs lead, this interdisciplinary conference will explore the âeconomyâ of scales in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, that is, the manner in which different scales — temporal and/or spatial, whole or part, macroscopic or microscopic, human or non-human, and local, national, or international — influence cultural, historical, literary and scientific practices in these periods. How do different scales influence our current understanding of these practices? What were the various scales, metrics, or ranges employed by eighteenth- and nineteenth-century figures? How did these scales organize these figuresâ understanding of their world? How did these scales direct cultural or scientific inquiry towards certain objects or areas of interest over others? What influence did they have on interpretive practices? How does scale factor in the way we approach eighteenth-and nineteenth century texts, artifacts, and practices now?  The Eighteenth-Century Studies Group (ECSG) & Nineteenth-Century Forum (NCF) are graduate interdisciplinary groups at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. We welcome contributors from all disciplines, such as History, Art History, Literature, and Comparative Literature on a wide range of topics. This is a two-day graduate student conference; submissions of either individual papers of full panels are welcome.  Themes could include, but are not limited to: â Spatial and temporal scale â Micro-histories and âbig historyâ â Time and nostalgia â Scale and academic periodization â Close and Distant Reading â Scale and the archive â Scale in scientific thought and practice â Scale and material culture â Local and Global â Cartographical approaches â Representations of Landscape and Nature â Scale and Politics â Micro and Macro Economics â Scale and Theological Thought â Scale and Print Culture(s) â Scale and aesthetics â Scales of Governance â Scale and genre  Please send an abstract or proposal of 300-500 words toÂ aranruth@umich.edu orÂ adsneed@umich.eduÂ byÂ November 1, 2013. Informal inquiries are also welcome. 3222 Angell Hall University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 435 State Street Ann Arbor, MI 48109
