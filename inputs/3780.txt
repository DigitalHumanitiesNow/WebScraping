Is the magic fabric working?  Maybe!   In the meantime, I feel like an animal just home from the vet with one of those Elizabethan collars so it can’t lick itself:   They’re hilarious on pets, but it turns out I’m not as fond of them on humans. Also, the thing hates the heat.  I got this creepy crawly feeling on my neck as I was running errands in the neighborhood.  Good thing we have air conditioning.
