The Catalogue of Ships that follows this invocation can be mapped as an itinerary, or more precisely, three itineraries that traverse most of Greece. By creating a mental journey that used the mnemonic techniques involving loci or places, well known from ancient rhetorical writers, Homer could mentally walk – or sail – through Greece and produce a detailed catalogue. In cooperation with the Scholars Lab of the University of Virginia, and using their “Neatline” program, “Least-cost path” GIS analysis, and links with the Pleiades Project, we will explore that itinerary. Our presentation will be work in progress and present some early findings concerning the organization of space in the Catalogue.
