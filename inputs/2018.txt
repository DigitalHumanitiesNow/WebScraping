 The folks I at my interview to whom I floated the idea of hosting #thatcamp SE were all very excited. #jobmarket # @ltwunder Welcome, then! in reply to ltwunder # @lindsaymartini bow-ba in reply to lindsaymartini # @KeepWundering I think your mom (@ltwunder) is following me on Twitter now. Although the day in class was probably enough to warn her. # I was very glad to have a campus interview last week. But I'm also regretting the non-existent spring break. # What someone just said to me: "you're practically the rocky horror picture show at this point." # @nowviskie I know. I'm looking forward to that. in reply to nowviskie # Wishing I was at #uvashape just so I could hear Todd Presner talk about what Hypercities is FOR. I haven't quite figured it out yet. # @DrewBrittain I'll have to give it a try. in reply to DrewBrittain # @cscannella True. I'll have to try that. in reply to cscannella # @nowviskie Why does UVA get all the cool conferences? in reply to nowviskie # Curses. I just got a beta invite to the Lego Universe MMOG, but it's PC only. # Grading #eng465 papers. # @DrewBrittain I like that Fang Island record. # @eetempleton I'll raise a magic grading pencil in salute! in reply to eetempleton # @eetempleton So you're on Spring Break now, right? # I'd like the Lego Prince of Persia sets a lot more if they weren't labeled PoP. # @FelixSmerd Wise choice. in reply to FelixSmerd # @erinsells And you're a flatterer. All good reasons to <3 you. in reply to erinsells # @erinsells I have 70 students. But constant grading with wikis, Zotero, papers, exams, and more. Lame. in reply to erinsells # And just got a request for another phone interview. Score! (For those keeping track, it's another #alt ac position.) #jobmarket # @erinsells I've told them that I feel very badly about things as they are. But I'm already working until 1am. I won't do 4am. in reply to erinsells # @erinsells Or you could just not grade them. I'm more than a month behind on stuff. in reply to erinsells # @captain_primate Yes, I thnik it did. Fingers are crossed. in reply to captain_primate # The real success of the interview was my ability to conceal that I had forgot my belt. Or they were too nice to stare. #jobmarket #Fail # Interview done. #Jobmarket # Successfully ate lunch w/o spilling anything. #jobmarket #ftw # Thanks all for the hellos. I seem to spend a large part of each #jobmarket interaction talking about Twitter. # I'm talking to a group of librarians about Twitter. Can people please say hi? # @mattthomas –I do not believe you will be able to pass this class. [3/3] in reply to mattthomas # @mattthomas Given the syllabus's attendance policy–where I write that "after six absences you risk failing the course"… [2/3] in reply to mattthomas # @mattthomas In looking over attendance for my classes, I noticed you have only attended X days out of the semester & have missed X days. 1/2 in reply to mattthomas # @roopikarisam The skeletons tied to everything always seem a little too much like lynching. Especially if you've been reading Baldwin. in reply to roopikarisam # Prepping for tomorrow's #jobmarket interview. # .@AlxJrvs My plan is twofold: Google Wave, but more important, a discussion teaching portable skills to humanities undergrads. #thatcamp in reply to AlxJrvs # Writing emails to students who will now fail my courses because of their attendance. # @cscannella It's a good album. I think it's like a rocked-up Fleet Foxes. in reply to cscannella # I'm trying to figure out if there is anyway to combine @readitlater with Readability (http://bit.ly/czGBkX). Thoughts, anyone? # @nickproth Mistakes have been made in a few places. All will probably still be well. in reply to nickproth # For everyone in #eng465 that wants to share links through Twitter, check out http://bit.ly. # @KeepWundering If they *weren't* more exciting, that would probably be a problem. in reply to KeepWundering # @FelixSmerd So you've just perfectly demonstrated the capability of Twitter as status update. in reply to FelixSmerd # Who on earth let me put Ginsberg and Plath on the same day? CursÃ¨d TTh schedule! #eng399 #e399 # @samplereality How do you like Ribbon Hero? in reply to samplereality # @andthensydsaid Score one for @zotero! in reply to andthensydsaid # @DrewBrittain @sydthe_kid Well, the bibliography was originally due on Tuesday. I bumped it back because I thought y'all'd like that. in reply to DrewBrittain # Dear Poetry Archive: I refuse to kruft up my computer with Real Player. Thank you. # @sydthe_kid Because. It builds character! in reply to sydthe_kid # @samplereality T-shirt size? You mean they didn't ask *you* for your Social Security number. in reply to samplereality # The oldest has a dinosaur project to do. He got Psittacosaurus. #saythatfivetimesquickly # @betajames Dan Cohen. in reply to betajames # @AlxJrvs So you get a little liquor in you, and you start knocking over pop stands. This *should* be entertaining. in reply to AlxJrvs # I'm tempted to extend apologies to #eng465 for the length of tomorrow's reading assignment. But…I won't. # @samplereality THARCamp is being held on the Appalachian Trail, right? in reply to samplereality # @lindsaymartini All the papers say, "Johnny is Truant!" in reply to lindsaymartini # @ryancordell Drat! But yay for graduation, right? in reply to ryancordell # @AlxJrvs Too bad you *still* won't know the rules for Munchkin. in reply to AlxJrvs # I'm in for #thatcamp 2010! w00t^7. # @ddchamberlain Cool. Thanks for this link. We'll ask you for more tips, I'm sure. in reply to ddchamberlain # @amndw2 @jcmeloni @samplereality Curses. in reply to amndw2 # @jcmeloni Right. I'm wondering how to get more people interested in doing the same. in reply to jcmeloni # .@samplereality Also, how can we kick a little fiscal love Twapper Keeper's way? in reply to samplereality # @samplereality Hmm. Useful. But what if other events are getting planned at the same time? Not that we couldn't deal with that, I suppose. in reply to samplereality # @samplereality I think there's good reason to use the standard hashtag and good reason to have our own, for Twapper purposes. in reply to samplereality # @nowviskie We'll have to see if you can make it through our rigorous vetting process, of course! http://bit.ly/anvItg in reply to nowviskie # @tigress31485 You don't *have* to be excited about it. After all, it's just an assignment. in reply to tigress31485 # @nowviskie @samplereality Which means that the lunch menu has already been set, right? in reply to nowviskie # @samplereality Hmm. That's a definited buzzkill. We can still work with Southern (Fried) ThatCamp: #S F)THATCamp. in reply to samplereality # @academicdave Universities are medieval institutions, designed to train clergy/priests. Some traditions have survived. in reply to academicdave # I missed this great news ystrday since I was teaching: Support for Regional THATCamps http://bit.ly/b6voos. We really *do* need #thatcampse # @academicdave Colleges are tradition-bound institutions.It's a big part of their imprimatur.Those subjects are also conspicuous consumption. in reply to academicdave # Newest mp3 of the week features @loscampesinos as well as my own quirky relation to the band: http://bit.ly/9efQUj.

The jerks should know they need to pay you $10/word. in reply to amandafrench # @omg_dinoz Extra double points for the name of your tumblog. # @Sethuality That's perfectly fine, as long as it's related. in reply to Sethuality # @erinsells SCORE! in reply to erinsells # RT @ProfHacker: Poll:  How often do you take your lunch to work?

But I'd buy board books rather than the originals. (But no one else will do med. kit.) in reply to erinsells # @erinsells The latter. But I told you some of the key things. They'd all be available at Target. Orajel would be good too. in reply to erinsells # @erinsells We frequently buy a medicine kit: infant tylenol, mylicone, nasal bulb, thermometer, etc. in reply to erinsells # @eetempleton You know, of course, that *all* @profhacker writers are automatically drafted. in reply to eetempleton # @eetempleton @chutry @billiehara Welcome aboard! in reply to eetempleton # @erinsells I might know a few people. in reply to erinsells # .@erinsells coins the hashtag for #THATCamp South East: #thatcampse # @foundhistory @benwbrum How terrifying to see how large my head is on that Twitter feed! in reply to foundhistory # .@samplereality I've been talking in #jobmarket interviews about running a Southern (Fried) #THATCamp  We can do it together? in reply to samplereality # @KickakiteWunder That's good to hear,coming 15 minutes after #eng465 in reply to KickakiteWunder # @sfirth605 Good thing such stuff never happens in #eng399 in reply to sfirth605 # Thanks to everyone who said "hi" to #eng465  It's always great to have such a real-time demonstration of what Twitter can do. # @DelaneyKirk This is also just one of several "weird" assignments I've given this class, so I think I've broken their spirits. [2/2] in reply to DelaneyKirk # @DelaneyKirk I am using a class hashtag (#eng465). A few of my students are on Twitter already, so I don't think it will be a problem. [1/2] in reply to DelaneyKirk # Showing Twitter to a class. Can people please say hi? # @amandafrench Congratulations! # @amndw2 I think people see it as dumbing down. A commodification, where patrons can't work w/o lattes.

Koss KSC75. Not all that expensive, but cheaper to mail them in and get them replaced than buying new ones. in reply to captain_primate # Curses. These headphones have a short.
