Yesterday, I attended a “Tech n Talk” presented by LIS Humanities Liaison Pete Coco and Film and New Media Studies Associate Professor Josh Stenger. Â Even though I usually spend Mondays working at home, I consider the time on campus well spent. Pete demonstrated Creative Commons, whose licenses I use, and showed us the SPARC clause that authors can add to standard publication contracts. Â I hadn’t yet seen a demo of a CC image search–or how hard Google makes it to search for freely available images. Josh offered not only a brief history of copyright from the Constitution forward but also information about ways in which publishers and others interfere with the ways we use devices we have purchased, including but far from limited to protections against “piracy.” Â I particularly appreciated his discussion of the way that new iterations of protections of intellectual property assume consumers are guilty without opportunity to prove innocence. The presentations meshed well with two great pieces I had come across during my morning troll of the web: Â Barbara Fister’s “Joining the Movement: A Call to Action” in Library JournalÂ and a blogpost she referenced, Steve Lawson’s “Publishers Hate You. You Should Hate Them Back.” Â Both of these pieces affirm my sense of the connections among scholarly communication, libraries, and digital scholarship. And that change is gonna come.Filed under: digital humanities
