 Publishers from HighWire Press are experimenting with a plugin called SocialCite. This is intended to rate the evidence, citation by citation. Like this: SocialCite at PNAS, HighWire Press from http://www.pnas.org/content/108/14/5488.full#ref-list-1: So far a few publishers (including PNAS) have implemented it as a pilot. Apparently the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery is apparently leading this effort, I’d be really interested in speaking with them further: Find out more about SocialCite from their website or the slidedeck from their debut at the HighwirePress meeting.  SocialCite makes its debut at the HighWire Press meeting  from Kent Anderson  I’m *very* curious to hear what peopel think of this — it really surprised me.
