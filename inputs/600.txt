http://bturn.com/4216/nazi-propaganda-posters-in-serbia-during-world-war-two   No Photoshop, no Illustrator, just plain olâ hand-painted Nazi advertising. Though obviously not as cool as the Soviet  One of the issues the Nazi authorities faced with the local population during four years in occupied Belgrade (1941-1945) was how to neutralise the ideological influence of both the Soviet Marxist-Leninism and Anglo-American liberal democracy. Among various other propaganda techniques, a well established means of mass political advertising were posters. Although the Nazis never reached the avant-garde coolness of Soviet design, it is certainly interesting to see how the German propaganda machinery worked in occupied Belgrade during the war. Itâs a simple story: Communists are death squads, Churchill is a drunken bastard and basically, theyâre all Jews.  âDear God, let my country be forever mine so I donât share it with time wastersâÂ  (Didnât the communists say that too? Anyway, itâs what right wing politicians still shout today. Down with time wasters, our country for our people!)  âWho will overcome? No one! Because the Jew keeps the balance in check. Visit the Anti-Masonic exhibition and see for yourself.âÂ  (Stalin is nothing but an action figure in the hands of old Jewish guys with beards.)  âBolsevism, rule of terror.â (Yes, itâs Tom Cruise from Vanilla Sky. Factories burning in the distance.)  âThis is England! Are the English friends of small nations?âÂ  (Churchill, Stalin and Roosevelt, somewhere between Adams Family and Robert Crumbâs characters. Stalin is the butcher, obviously, hatchet soaked in blood; incompetent Roosevelt limping in the background, both lead by olâ Winston for a glass of whiskey, Grim Reaper navigating from behind. In case youâre short of inspiration for your next Halloween partyâ¦)  âBack off, communist monster!âÂ  (A sturdy Serbian peasant â forever in his late 50s â fights back a charging commie. Itâs all about the giant corn, really.)  âSerbs. Everyday moto is ORDER and WORK.â (Actually, itâs not.)  âLiberator? No, never.â (But hey, those cheekbonesâ¦)  âMother Serbia, they are leading you to your death, but for their own sake.âÂ  (American and British officers grabbing poor mother Serbia, with a help of a naked commie.)  âNo one to thank but Germany for chasing away this danger out of Serbia and Europe.âÂ  (Wait, you mean this enraged triple-headed King Kong?)  (Churchill is drunk. And heâs a Jew.) *Images taken from:Â UÄionica istorije
