A workshop to be held at DH2015 â Sydney, Australia â Workshop dates: June 29-30Â  Do you work with undergraduates in digital humanities programs? Want to share experiences and discuss best practices with other practitioners? This Digital Humanities 2015 pre-conference, half-day workshop will use case studies of âstart-upâ undergraduate DH programs as a jumping off point for a broader discussion about whether undergraduate digital programs must indeed start from scratch at each new institution, and whether it is possible to craft a transnational document for DH best practices. We aim to include participants from as wide a range of geographical locations and roles (faculty, students, librarians, archivists, instructional technologists, IT professionals, program directors, etc.) within DH initiatives as possible. The central issues driving this workshop are: The challenges of establishing DH programs at teaching and undergraduate-centered institutions The ways in which the pedagogical needs of undergraduate institutions and undergraduate-centered DH programs differ from and dovetail with those of larger research universities The role of and challenges to undergraduate-focused DH programs around the world How the discussions about digital humanities taking place on liberal arts campuses relate to broader questions that animate the field of digital pedagogy   Workshop Structure At the workshop, participants will present short introductions to their undergraduate DH programs and outline one main takeaway each. Â Both organizers and participants will work to draw attention to commonalities and differences among presentations, before opening up the floor to design-thinking exercises and formal discussions designed to add material to the whiteboard scaffold. The workshop itself will: Invite participants to share different approaches to undergraduate-centered DH programs, incorporating global perspectives Workshop some general solutions to common undergraduate-DH problems, share local challenges, and collaborate on strategies for particular problems Define common principles and pedagogical reasoning, keeping in mind the variety and experimental nature of different initiatives Explore the many different forms of undergraduate-focused digital programs Chart recent developments in digital liberal arts pedagogy In addition to sharing insights from different programs during an in-person session, this workshop also aims to codify some best practices for building and sustaining new digital humanities programs for undergraduates. Â Drawing on the success of crowd-sourced best practices, we will compile what weâve learned into a collaborative, public document Â that speaks to the needs of undergraduates, their teachers and their institutions in the digital age. Outcomes In advance of the workshop, participants will be invited to scaffold a best-practices whitepaper identifying different pedagogies, challenges and questions they want the workshop to address. Â A version of this document will be circulated in advance of the workshop. Â After the conference, presenters will work together to transition the document into a more formal whitepaper and to compile an accompanying bibliography, linking the issues raised to the existing literature. This public document will be informative, rather than prescriptive. Â It is intended to highlight the practitionersâ points of view. Â It will share and solicit contributions from attendees as well as those not present. Â Overall, the goal of this workshop and whitepaper is to share undergraduate DH practitionersâ experiences, with an eye to how others around the world Â can learn from or build upon those experiences.   Submission Guidelines Please draft a ~500 word narrative of your experience working with undergraduates on digital humanities programs/ projects/ initiatives. Your narrative should be submitted to startingfromscratchDH (at) gmail (dot) com by March 31st. Proposals might share issues encountered while building undergraduate-centered DH programs, identify successful strategies for undergraduate DH education, or highlight possibilities for future DH pedagogical developments. Participants can register for the workshop at the DH2015 site. While you needn’t have applied to attend the workshop, we hope that those who are interested will share their experiences with undergrad DH practice in advance, so that we can better shape the workshop to participants’ needs.Â  We also anticipate that early applicants will take more of a leadership role in the workshop.
