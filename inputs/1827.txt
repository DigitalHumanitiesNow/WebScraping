Excited to join Alex Weheliye, Marisa Parham, Schuyler Esprit, and Kevin Browne on a panel about #dh, data, afrofuturism, and Black/African diaspora studies at the American Studies Association Annual Meeting in Toronto! Our panel was accepted: Data and Diaspora Catalogues: Black Life and Death in the Future Space This session explores ways black life is replicated and rationalized on screen and as data in an age of black death. As black studies moves into the second decade of the twenty-first century, practitioners of black studies in the academy and beyond continue to grapple with the fungibility of black life. As work by Sylvia Wynter, Katherine McKittrick, and Joy James has shown, black humanity (or its elision from the category of Man) sits uncomfortably against new interest in digital tools, methods, and analyses being employed in humanistic studies. The panelists gathered here ask a series of questions about ways black life and death meet in a world where the digital and analog intersect to build new humans. Questions include: How is black life replicated and rationalized on screen and as data? How do we engage with new cyborg racializing assemblages at the interface level–i.e., programming notions of big data into black experiences, then and now? What do we gain and lose in such engagements? In what ways can the digital serve as a hotspot for the throbbing resilience of black life? Panelists engage these questions and present original research from their work as scholars and practitioners in digital blackness and diaspora studies. See you there!
