Ines Cox: De Nieuwe Oogst, poster series (via It’s Nice That) This weekend I’ll be attending the Parsons/Carnegie Mellon “Matter(ing) by Design” conference, where, on Saturday morning, I’m moderating a panel — titled “The Political and Social Consequences of Materializing” (essentially, the race, class, and gender politics of design) — with Genevieve Bell of Intel and Deb Chachra of Olin College. And then next Tuesday I’m presenting a keynote address (title TBD!) on the “meta-aesthetics” of the art library at the New York Art Resources Consortium‘s annual conference at the Museum of Modern Art. The NYARC is a collaboration between MoMA, the Frick, and the Brooklyn Museum.
