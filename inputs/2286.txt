 My blog hasnât quite caught up the fact that I now have two jobs to go along with my two lives. Monday to Wednesday Iâm still part of the Trove management team at the National Library of Australia, but on Thursdays and Fridays Iâm Associate Professor of Digital Heritage in the Faculty of Arts and Design at the University of Canberra.  I love working with the Trove team, but I also want to keep contributing to the development of the digital humanities in Australia through my own teaching and research. Hopefully now I can do both. At the University of Canberra Iâll be helping to develop new digital heritage offerings in undergraduate, postgraduate and professional development courses. Exciting times ahead! On the research front Iâm hoping to reinvigorate a few stalled projects and poke around some more amidst the possibilities and politics of digital cultural collections. These are the themes Iâm thinking about at the moment. Digital diversity Using digital tools to expose alternative voices and experiences from within the cultural record. Invisible Australians â yes itâs time to give this important project a home and kick it into gear Every life counts â this is the working title for a new project around workplace deaths I also want to expand on some of the questions inÂ Seams and edges Access, impact and understanding How digitisation projects change our relationship with the past. I want to pursue some of the themes in Life on the outside Trove Traces — more analysis please! Data-enriched narratives Developing new forms of online publication that use Linked Open Data to integrate historical writing and cultural collections. Continuing along the path described in Stories for machines, data for humans All that in two days a week â wish me luck! And if you’re interested in collaborating, please get in touch…
