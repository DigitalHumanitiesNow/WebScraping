On January 2nd Jenna and I embarked on a little dietary journey called Whole 30. If you’re not familiar, it’s a 30-day commitment to a pretty restricted diet that intends to rework the participant’s relationship with food. I say that: Jenna’s done most of the prep work for us. There’s a book, a pretty robust website, and tons of other resources that she’s plumbed, but I’ve just been along for the ride. I’d certainly agree that my relationship with food consumption could use a solid change–but I’m not too excited about it. Still, I’m in and I’m pretty sure it doesn’t count unless you blog/post to social media about your experience with Whole 30. If I’m not miscounting, I have nearly completed day 5 and it’s not been too horrible. The first two days were a little rough, but then I discovered that potatoes–even regular potatoes–are part of the program. After a good potato fix, I’m feeling less hungry and generally happier. The biggest issue is that Whole 30 really isn’t designed for people who don’t eat meat. I’ve been meat free since early 2011 and I really have no intentions of changing that, but it’s difficult to get protein within the Whole 30. In order to get protein sufficient for this program (which, mind you, cuts out legumes and soy almost entirely) I’ve had to consume a ton of eggs. I’d rather not eat eggs, at least not in this quantity. Despite all that, I think this Whole 30 business is a good idea and I’m glad to be giving it a try. I know several folks who are much happier having completed it–so much so that they keep going back to it. Perhaps the best new about Whole 30 is that it’s completely cool with kombucha. With that in mind, I finally put my mind to making my own. Having squandered the scoby that I was given, I’m growing my own from some unfiltered/unflavored kombucha. More fermented foods/drinks, say I.
