 5.3.12 | Library of Congress, Manuscript Reading Room I found an interesting document in the Library of Congress this week, and provides an example of the kind of tiny, incrementalÂ pleasures that historians sometimes experience in the archives.Â  In 1941, the U.S. Travel Bureau, a division of the Department of Interior, produced the guide above, Negro Hotels and Guest Houses,Â for African American Travelers. Gretchen SullivanÂ Sornin, in her excellent dissertation on the history of the Green Book, has noted that there are few extant records of the US Travel Bureau and its activities, but that the Bureau partnered with and distributed the Green Book, giving the publication theÂ officialÂ support that enabled it to become the most successful of the travel guides from this period.Â  Because of the lack of records, we don’t know very much about the thinking or intentions around this publication, which would be very interesting, as they were a Federal agency actingÂ during a period where there seemed to be a some changing perspectives on race. While researching complaints about hotels sent to the N.A.A.C.P Â in the manuscript collections at the Library of Congress, Â I found a 1937Â letter from Walter White, then Secretary of the N.A.A.C.P, to Harold Ickes, Secretary of the Department of Interior, suggesting that the Bureau publish a travel guide for African Americans.Â Â  There is nothing surprising about this connection–the N.A.A.C.P was active in documenting and prosecuting violations to state Civil Rights law, particularly after WWII–but it does provide a little bit of clarity about where theÂ US Travel Bureau may have gotten the idea to publish its guide. I was delighted to find this document, and its a perfect example of how serendipitous research can be–you can find the answer to one question while you are looking hard for the answer to something else.
