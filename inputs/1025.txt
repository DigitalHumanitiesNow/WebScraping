Sometimes after a long day, especially at the end of a long week, one’s mind turns to geographic amusement, or geo-musings. Â Here’s mine for the day – courtesy of Emily. Â Use a digital map to help you find the middle ground to meet a friend. This brings veracity to meeting in the middle! Two guys played with this idea as an art project and first met somewhere in the Czech Republic, then later up a tree in Westchester County. Emotionally appealing idea of making the commitment and then trusting each other to follow through, come hell, high water, traffic delays, or GPS errors. I like this definition of art works by Roy Ascott, as a “trigger of experiences” rather than an “object.” Wanted to play with different approaches for calculating exactly what “the middle” is? Â Of course, it’s a geospatial question! Â Try this Geographic Midpoint app. Thanks, Emily!
