I put together Open Season as my final project for Paula's Hist 697 class in spring 2004. I hadn't given it much thought until I noticed on a Technorati search that a few people outside the U.S. have recently commented on the site. Check it out:  WWII ÃÂ«Ã??Â¡Â±â¥Â¬?Î©Ã?Â¥ÃÂ«â¡ÃÂ«âÂ¬ÃÃ ÃÃ¯Ãâ¦ÃÃâ¦â Ãâ¦ÃÃÂ«Â®Ãâ¦â¥Ãâ¦Æ at Hugo Strikes Back, which is in Japanese I think. Actually, I'll admit ignorance. I have no idea what language it's in. Cartel Anti-Japons at Icasne!, which I believe is in Portugese or Spanish. Octopus Japonicus at Comomola. Like the Hugo Strikes Back! post, I'm not sure exactly what language it's in. Any assistance in translating these posts would be greatly appreciated. Babelfish doesn't seem to get it right. Or if there are any good website translators out there feel free to pass them along.  And for those George Mason history students who take Paula's class, be warned: People will find the site you make if you keep it up long enough. I've been meaning to do some work on Open Season but haven't had the time.
