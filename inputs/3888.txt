I was truly honored when the Virginia Historical Society, a wonderful museum and archive, asked me to give one of the famous Banner Lectures on my book.  Oddly enough, though I've presented various parts at a number of conferences, I've never done a formal presentation of the whole project.  So, I had a good time putting this talk together and it turned out pretty well.  I got some great questions from the audience.
