We have recently published six volumes of Papal documents on British History Online. These are assorted volumes of three different types.  The Calendar of State Papers Relating to English Affairs in the Vatican Archives is a two-volume series covering the early years of the reign of Elizabeth I; it details the initially cautious reaction of the Vatican to the accession of a Protestant monarch to the English throne, and the subsequent excommunication of Elizabeth in 1570. Petitions to the Pope covers petitions made from the British Isles in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. There are currently three volumes of the Calendar of Papal Registers Relating to Great Britain and Ireland; the series calendars entries in the Vatican Archives. More volumes of this latter series will be published on British History Online over the next few months.
