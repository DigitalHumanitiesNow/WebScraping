Ramnath Vaidyanathan, Kenton Russell, and the very clever people at RStudio have released the htmlwidgets package for R. The package is âa framework that seamlessly bridges R and JavaScript.â It provides a way to integrate JavaScript libraries, especially for visualization, into R packages. This is intended to make it easy to include dynamic visualizations in Knitr documents or even in the R Console. Eventually Iâd like to develop an R package to do this for Elijah Meekâs excellent d3-carto-map.
