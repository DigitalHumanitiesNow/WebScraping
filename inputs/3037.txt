The pen is mightier than the sword – Edward Bulwer-Lytton (1839) While having a discussion about teaching and technology the other day, it came to my attention that local schools were no longer instructing students in the art of cursive writing. Although I have heard rumours that cursive writing was being eliminated in schools in the Southern United States, the idea that my own child might not be taught handwriting when he attends school in 2 years struck a chord a little closer to home. I decided to do a little homework on what people are saying about the elimination of cursive writing from the education system, and at the same time I thought Iâd complete a course assignment and create a âHow ToâÂ  blog about learning to write in cursive. The elimination of handwriting from the grade school classroom has received a fair bit of attention in the past while. Some bloggers, like myself, seem unsure of where they stand and are left wondering what will happen if no one in the upcoming generation knows the art of handwriting. The general consensus at the moment seems to be that handwriting is still an essential skill, despite the fact that it will likely not be used every day. Arguments for teaching handwriting include that the practice tunes fine motor skills, trains the brain to connect hand-activity with memory, and that it helps to connect students with their past. My main concern when I think of handwriting not being taught is that these students will never get to discover a creative side of themselves that previous generations have taken for granted. No oneâs handwriting is the same; the act of putting pen to paper is quite literally one of placing yourself on the page. I just received a Christmas card that was created online, and while I know that itâs the thought that counts, there were no signatures or notes of any kind made on the card, just a simple âMerry Christmasâ in a generic font. Handwriting, and signatures more specifically, make things special, unique, and genuine. We can type all we want, but our handwriting defines us, it makes us stand out from all the others, it is an artistic skill, and for many, it is a thing of beauty. Where, then, would one start to look online for places to learn about handwriting? What sites provide the necessary information to help the next generation learn this skill at home, if they are not to receive these lessons at school? The following list will provide a starting place for adults to learn handwriting themselves, or to refresh their memories and help their children with their cursive classes. Step One: The Importance of Handwriting – A History of Cursive In order to understand the importance of the skill you are about to learn, it is useful to look to the past and see the ways that handwriting has played a role in many different cultures. This site: http://www.2020site.org/writing/history.html provides this very information, showing how different types of script have prevailed over others at certain points in time and detailing the difference between ideographic and phonetic systems of writing. Once you have explored the history of cursive writing, this site gives details about ways to hold your pen, where to position yourself at your desk, and provides worksheets for beginning to learn your cursive letters. Although there are instructions for creating the letters on this site, they are extremely detailed and might intimidate one who is new to cursive writing. I suggest taking the historical knowledge from this site and moving on. Step Two: Video instruction As the web allows for many types of communication, I suggest taking advantage of this and watching this video that details what you will need to get started with cursive writing: http://www.howcast.com/videos/353527-How-To-Write-in-Cursive. While this video doesnât provide the necessary worksheets, it suggests you look on line for them and gives you important tips such as practicing the same shape of letters at the same time to learn cursive more quickly. The subject of the video is an adult female, which helps to show that this skill can be learned at any age, and helps those who didnât have the opportunity to learn it in grade school feel comfortable taking it on. Once you have yourself set up with a pen, lined paper or tracing sheets, and an internet connection, you should turn to the more detailed series of videos by Susan Corbett:http://voices.yahoo.com/video/homeschool-lesson-writing-cursive-252845.html?cat=4. There is a video available for each letter of the alphabet, and the upper case and lower case letters are covered in each video. Susan takes her time with the lessons, and clearly details how many lines are needed to create each letter and where they should be on the page. This series is intended for children who are home-schooled, and, like the video above, defines letters by their type (ex. Â âclimb and slideâ =Â  I u w t , or âlumpy lettersâ = m n v x) to help with learning quickly. Although it doesnât have the music or visual components that make a lot of the other available videos more âfunâ, this video gets right to the point and is easy to follow. Step Three: Practice makes Perfect Now that you are familiar with the cursive style, you might find it helpful to practice on your own, without the aid of a video. This site: http://www.kidzone.ws/cursive/index.htm provides worksheets for practicing your letters and also groups them into the types of letters that you would have been learning if you followed the video instructions. Once youâve mastered the individual letters, you might want to start writing words and sentences that interest you. Although you can copy words from a book, this often times means that you would be looking at print and focusing on making cursive from those words, which can be confusing. Instead, try making your own worksheets here: http://www.handwritingworksheets.com/cursive-1/make-c.htm You can put in a series of words and create a worksheet that is printable for practice. You can start with a series of single letters and work up to joining them into words, and then making them into sentences and paragraphs. And in case anyone ever asks you, and you don’t have a keyboard nearby, you can even practice writing the name of your blog!
