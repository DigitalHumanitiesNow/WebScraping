I’ve compiled together my notes and tweets from theÂ Seeing, Doing, Thinking: Visualisation as Knowledge CreationÂ session at theÂ Theoretical Archaeology Group conference (#TAG2013)Â held in Bournemouth this week. I was planning to live blog, but the session was so engrossing that I am afraid I managed just a few tweets and scribbled thoughts in the end! I was presenting a project that I have been working on with Jude Jones. She is the brains behind the whole thing, I have merely been helping with computational photography!Â The paper about the project has yet to be written, but we are busy plotting, so watch this space! We were talking about the potential of RTI as a form of visualisation for reading the tomb of Dame Mary May which is situated in a small and very lovely church in Lavant, near Chichester, West Sussex. More about that in a soon to be written blog post, but first I’ve copied in my tweets and accompanying notes from the session. These are scruffy at best, but at least they give an idea of the fantastic papers that we enjoyed. The session organisers (Gareth Beale, Sara Perry and Catriona Cooper) maintain a blog which pulls together all of the various activities surrounding the Seeing, Thinking, Doing idea, the TAG2013 session being just one of these events, so do check out their blog for more information:Â http://seeingthinkingdoing.wordpress.com/ Tweets from Session Paper abstracts here:Â http://seeingthinkingdoing.wordpress.com/tag-2013-bournemouth/ Session Introductions We’re just starting in theÂ #visualarchaeoÂ session atÂ #TAG2013.
