FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE HANOVER, N.H. – March 2, 2015 – Dartmouth Collegeâs Tiltfactor, an interdisciplinary innovation studio, is excited to announce new work with collections from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. A living memorial to the Holocaust, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum inspires citizens and leaders worldwide to confront hatred, prevent genocide, and promote human dignity. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum will work with Tiltfactor to use Metadata Games, an open source crowdsourcing game platform, to collect data on a select subset of its collection of 89,000 historical photographs. On Wednesday, March 25, through April 3, Tiltfactorâs Zen Tag and Guess What! will exclusively contain images from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum’s collection. During this limited time, get first-hand access to these powerful images. Building on Tiltfactor’s expertise on crowdsourcing, this project will help the Museum better understand and provide access to its collections.  Photograph from the Photo Archives of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum  Tiltfactor invites the public to help the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum build their photo archives’ descriptive metadata, expanding the archives’ accessibility for public research, reuse, and repurposing. While the images commonly used in Metadata Games are important, this is the first time the platform has been used to collect data about such a serious subject matter.
