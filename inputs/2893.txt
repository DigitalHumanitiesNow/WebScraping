During the month of December I am participating in #reverb14 as a means of getting my writing habits back on track. I will be altering the prompts as needed to fit within the scope of this blog. Prompt: Challenges.  What did you wrestle with in 2014?  What did you learn?  What challenges do you foresee in 2015?This past year I wrestled with how to turn down great projects that I simply didn't have time to do justice to. In 2015 I foresee a few new challenges including:Finalizing a paper on sports images and residential school archives.  This was one of the few projects I took on part way through 2014, as it draws directly on a lot of the work I've done with the Rev Father William Maurice fonds in the Shingwauk Residential Schools Centre.  I'm continuing to be part of a couple of public history committees and part of a conference organizing committee. There will be lots of planning and implementation work in the next year relating to those commitments.I will be returning to work in June 2015 after taking seven months off as maternity leave.  This will be another huge life/work adjustment.
