Scads of it at the Reading Terminal Market: http://bit.ly/8Whdt0. # Can't decide if my Tweetdeck #MLA09 column  is making me happy (cuz I'm in the loop) or lonesome.

Screwing up a cool roommate's plans. Second worst: @Delta's $150 cancellation fee. # @boonebgorges I'm glad you stifled that emotion and talked with us instead. in reply to boonebgorges # Case Western had over 500 applicants. #jobmarket # @triproftri Thanks for the encouragement and for the suggestions for placement. I've got more spare time this semester. Will work on it. in reply to triproftri # @jbj You're right. That was a slip. Would still love to do it.

(Moderator counts as half a panelist.) # @midwinter_ Sorry. IE is an automatic fail. Do not pass go. Do not collect job. in reply to midwinter_ # #MLA09 Tip: Everyone knows that academics are critical thinkers. Not bound by convention. That's why you should *only* use Apple products. # Rt @samplereality: Please retweet:: A complete list of digital humanities sessions at #MLA09: http://bit.ly/2fBCRT # Signing up for new phone service.

I'm pretty sure I won't be at #MLA09 for the same reason. #jobmarket #fail # @academicdave I prefer to think of all those #MLA09 attendees as the *real* winners. in reply to academicdave # #MLA09 Tip: Registration, $125. Hotel, $300. Dinner and drinks, $65. Finding Stanley Fish's room and stealing his dry cleaning, priceless. # #MLA09 Tip: In the past, attendees resorted to funky spectacles to help them appear hip. Be cutting edge: 2010 is the year of the tonsure. # #MLA09 Tip: Also, Comp Lit applicants are expected to wear black. Surprise committee & go full-bore sartorial albino. They won't forget you! # @samplereality I couldn't find the #mla09 Twapper Keeper URL, although it said it was created.

Don't let people getting on unnerve you. Unnerve *them* with your brilliance. # @derekbruff There is communal space at #MLA09 for interviews. I call it "the pit." But it's worse than hotel room interview. Cattle call. in reply to derekbruff # @fearv Really? One of my favorite sounds ever, when it's in a large space, like a library reading room. #quirk in reply to fearv # @mlaconvention I can never decide if the trauma studies woman (my field) or the Irish Rave specialist is my favorite. in reply to mlaconvention # @mlaconvention Nothing more than what is listed on the "Credits" page.
