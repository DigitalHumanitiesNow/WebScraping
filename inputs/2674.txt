 A guest post by Theresa Kenney on gamification in #engl205. This post is an introduction to Theresa’sÂ mini-seriesÂ aboutÂ designing and delivering badges.Â    It’s one thing to brainstorm ideas and another to put them to work. After scribbling down inconclusiveÂ ideas based on research reportsÂ aboutÂ gamification in Higher Ed, Michael and IÂ were compelled to join the ‘Gamification in Higher Ed’ club. We wanted to presentÂ a âtangibleâ award systemÂ to students forÂ #engl205. But how? As Michael previously explained in this series, we made our decisions on what kind of gamification would implemented and how. But in practice, the process was much more complicated. Therefore, here begins my mini-series on our #engl205 ideas in practice. The next threeÂ blog posts will explain: The gears and partsÂ of ourÂ award-system. That is, how it worked and interacted with students (a two-parter beginning here). And what myÂ expectations were with using points and badges, and the outcomes and provoking questions that came up after implementation (*coming soon*).
