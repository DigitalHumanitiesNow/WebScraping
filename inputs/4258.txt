With the 2015 Kentucky Derby set to take place on Saturday, May 2nd, I was curious to see if the Delaware Historical Society owns an old rare book with an equestrian theme, and, sure enough, it does. Below are excerpts for this week’s Old Book—Â “Ten Minutes Advice to Every Gentleman Going to Purchase a Horse and The Gentleman’s Pocket-Farrier Shewing How To Use Your Horse on a Journey.Â ” Â This informative and partially amusing little curiosity was published in 1787.
