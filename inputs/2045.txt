Virtual Research Environments are often highly specialised concentrating         efforts around a single collection. The gMan project aims to demonstrate cross-collection discovery,         annotation, reporting and management in an on-demand VRE (using gCube) with three heterogeneous         classical collections: The Heidelberger Gesamtverzeichnis (HGV), Projet Volterra and The Inscriptions         of Aphrodisias (IAph).
