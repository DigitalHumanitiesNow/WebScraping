November 14, 2012 / 1:00 - 2:30 p.m. (Eastern Time)[snip]About the WebinarIncreasingly, many aspects of scholarly communicationâparticularly publication, research data, and peer reviewâundergo scrutiny by researchers and scholars. Many of these practitioners are engaging in a variety of ways with Alternative Metrics (#altmetrics in the Twitterverse). Alternative Metrics take many forms but often focus on efforts to move beyond proprietary bibliometrics and traditional forms of peer referencing in assessing the quality and scholarly impact of published work. Join NISO for a webinar that will present several emerging aspects of Alternative Metrics.AgendaIntroductionTodd Carpenter, Executive Director at NISO[snip]Article-Level Metrics at PLOSMartin Fenner, Technical Lead, PLOS Article-Level Metrics projectArticle-Level Metrics have become an exciting new opportunity for publishers, funders, universities and researchers. The publisher Public Library of Science (PLOS) has started to collect and display citations, usage data, and social web activity for all their articles in 2009. The webinar will discuss the opportunities (and challenges) of Article-Level Metrics, from issues in collecting data to interesting results of data analysis.Total-Impact and other altmetrics initiativesJason Priem, Ph.D. Student, Co-Principal Investigator, Impact StoryAltmetrics helps us track diverse scholarly impacts by looking in new places for evidence--public places like Wikipedia and Twitter, and scholarly environments like Mendeley and Faculty of 1000. Doing this lets us promote and reward new forms of Web-native scholarship in two ways. Broader measures of impact  help us movebeyond the article:  we can value the increasingly important and powerful new genres of scholarly products like blog posts, software, and datasets, andbeyond the impact factor: we can value the observed impact of scholarly products themselves, across lots of different audiences and use types--not just awarding the prestige of where they're published.That said, altmetrics can be tricky to gather and understand. We'll discuss tools and frameworks to help turn rich but dense altmetrics data into data-supported stories that can help inform important conversations about what it means to make a scholarly impact.Unconventional Scholarly CommunicationsAalam Wassef, Founder of Peer EvaluatiParticipate in Aalam's survey on social networks at https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/VNZSNRZ Scholars are blogging, microblogging, searching, sharing primary data, collaborating, discussing, rating, bookmarking articles in public folders, recommending links over public networks, offering live coverages of events and receiving badges, views, likes or mentions for all they do online and elsewhere. More than ever, scholars are communicating and getting credit for it, with no limitations as to style, format or environment, enjoying high levels of engagement and responsiveness from their peers.How are all other parties concerned (librarians, public funders, policy makers, publishers universities, research centers) absorbing, supporting or rejecting all of the above?Could âunconventionalâ communications and alternative metrics be eventually as valued as peer reviewed articles and proprietary bibliometrics? How much of these altmetrics are truly accessible and for free, and what would be the alternatives to potential limitations?What is the current perception of direct publishing and open peer review, whether by individuals, groups or institutions? What are the risks and opportunities for the production of high quality research?Event Q&A[more]Source and Links Available At:[http://www.niso.org/news/events/2012/nisowebinars/alternative_metrics/]
