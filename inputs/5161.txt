On November 20, 2013, Manfred Laubichler gave a presentation at the Berlin 11 Open Access Conference, titled "Transforming Research and Education in the 21st Century: The Role of Open Access".  Making its scientistsâ research findings available for the benefit of the whole of humanity, free of charge whenever possible (Open Access), is a key aspiration of the Max Planck Society. Out of this spirit, the âBerlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanitiesâ was initiated by the Max Planck Society in October 2003.  Tags: newsconferences
