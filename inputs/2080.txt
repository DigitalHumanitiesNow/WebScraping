Lisa Spiro has posted an excellent entry on her blog for newcomers titled 'Getting Started in the Digital Humanities': "Iâd like to offer some ideas for how a newcomer might get acquainted  with the community and dive into DH work. I should emphasize that many  in the DH community are to some extent self-taught and/or gained their  knowledge through work on projects rather than through formal training.  In my view, whatâs most important is being open-minded, experimental,  and playful, as well as grounding your learning in a specific project  and finding insightful people with whom can you discuss your work."Highlights:Determine what goals or questions motivate you.Get acquainted with the digital humanitiesParticipate in the DH communityStay informedExplore examples for inspiration and modelsPursue trainingOnline tutorials Learn standards and best practicesFind collaboratorsPlan a pilot projectWhere possible, adopt/adapt existing toolsSome of the comments are from practicing DHers.
