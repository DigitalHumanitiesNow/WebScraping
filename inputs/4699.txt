I work at the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities, and we are hiring a full time programmer. This programmer will work on a bunch of exciting projects like the ones listed on our Projects Page or our Nebraska Portal Page. Some of my favorites are listed below. At the Center we create projects for various digital humanities topics. We make between 2-5 complete sites in a year. We also work on other smaller projects, such as adding features to existing Center projects and doing standalone experiments and research. One thing thatâs great about working here is the technical staff are part of the research teams set up for various projects. As such, we have the freedom to try things out and experiment (within reason, we have to maintain most of the things we create) and influence the direction the projects take. Being part of the research also means having the opportunity to publish and present on technical topics if we choose (though we are not required to publish or perish like our tenured counterparts). This position would work with and direct students with a programming background, and occasionally gets pulled in to teach sessions or give workshops on aspects of programming for digital humanities courses, (un)conferences, and workshop series. The atmosphere is one of collaboration and learning. If you canât tell, I love where I work. Itâs a great workplace and we get to do really cool stuff. You would do well if: You are well versed in some modern programming framework You are good at working on a team and articulating technical issues You enjoy research You like discussing your research in a clear, articulate way (having a blog is a plus!) You love the humanities You like to try new things and experiment You are interested in alternative ways to present data: mapping, visualizations, graphs You love XML or are willing to develop a love for XML Sound interesting? Here is the job ad. The application deadline is August 27, 2014. If you have any questions, I would be happy to answer them. Just email me at karin [at] nirak.net Some of my favorite projects: The Willa Cather Archive – This is the definitive online archive for all things Willa Cather. The Geographic Chronology is a particularly interesting part of the Cather Archive. Civil War Washington – A site examining the transformation of Washington D.C. during the Civil War. Interesting parts are the map, the data section](http://civilwardc.org/data/), and the medical cases. Gilded Age Plains City – This site explores the city of Lincoln, Nebraska during the Gilded Age, through the lens of the Sheedy Murder Trial of 1891. Nebraska Newspapers – As the title implies, this is where you can access Nebraska Newspapers. This is the Nebraska version of the Library of Congressâs Chronicling America but here we can include some papers that are not eligible for the national site, like the Daily Nebraskan. Omaha & Ponca Digital Dictionary – This was a fun site to work on in terms of interface and content. Trans-Mississippi & International Exposition – A digital archive of materials from the Exposition held in Omaha in 1898. The Walt Whitman Archive – The Whitman Archive has been around for about 20 years and has a wealth of information. The William F. Cody Archive – This archive for William F.
