 Does your library use BiblioCommons as its catalog? LibraryThing and BiblioCommons now work together to give you high-quality reading recommendations in your BiblioCommons catalog. You can see some examples here. Look for “LibraryThing Recommends” on the right side.  Not That Kind of Girl (Daniel Boone Regional Library) Carthage Must Be Destroyed (Ottowa Public Library) The Martian (Edmonton Public Library) Little Bear (West Vancouver Memorial Library) Station Eleven (Chapel Hill Public Library) The Brothers Karamazov (Calgary Public Library) Quick facts: As with all LibraryThing for Libraries products, LibraryThing Recommends only recommends other books within a library’s catalog. LibraryThing Recommends stretches across media, providing recommendations not just for print titles, but also for ebooks, audiobooks, and other media. LibraryThing Recommends shows up to two titles up front, with up to three displayed under “Show more.” Recommendations come from LibraryThing’s recommendations system, which draws on hundreds of millions of data points in readership patterns, tags, series, popularity, and other data. Not using BiblioCommons? Well, you can get LibraryThing recommendationsâand much moreâintegrated in almost every catalog (OPAC and ILS) on earth, with all the same basic functionality, like recommending only books in your catalog, as well as other LibraryThing for Libraries feaures, like reviews, series and tags. Check out some examples on different systems here.
