 I’m pleased to announce that ourÂ THATCamp Junior projectâmaking a film with our kidsâwill take place on Friday and Saturday, 8-9 July, in Atlanta. We know it’s not much advanced notice, but we invite others to come and play along with us. Get in touch with me via Twitter if you’re interested!
