All sorts of asses âloveâ poetry. Why not? It confirms them in the assininity of their deepest beliefs. It underlies the racial laziness, the unwillingness to think, the satisfaction of feeling oneself part of the race and of having all posterity behind one in proneness and stupidity. This is what is inherent in most âloveâ of poetry.A smooth, lying meter that nostalgically carries them back to sleep is what they want. Thatâs why for a living, changing people only the new poetry is truly safe, truly worth reading. And that is why it is opposed by the best peopleâthe intellectually deepest boggedâas if it were the devil himself.     —William Carlos Williams, âNote: The American Language and the New Poetry, so calledâ (1931?)
