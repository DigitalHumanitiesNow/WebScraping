Or, Don’t Even Get Him Started on CrossFit  Richard Cleveland was a sailor, an entrepreneurial merchant, and a well-traveled man â but not a shy one. In his retirement, he published at least three editions of his memoirs, and by the end of the nineteenth century, and he and his children had produced some three different versions of his life’s story, all also in multiple transatlantic editions. Scholars still look to him today for details on Americans’ dealings in the Pacific, and beyond. He’s a good source, if one we should perhaps examine mainly for its narrative framing and plot elements as much as for specific details. Among other feats, he was, as he explained in the preface to his lengthy autobiography of his time spent on the seas, as good a flinty, thrifty New Englander as Max Weber (or Freeman Hunt) could ever have wished for: The character of the citizens of New England for enterprise and industry, is very generally acknowledged. Being for the most part obliged to seek their own fortunes, they are thus early accustomed to the endurance of privations, and to those industrious and frugal habits, which lead to competence and wealth. In the pursuit of that independence of which all are more or less desirous, of persevering determination, of disregard of fatigue and suffering, which are very remarkable; but which pass unobserved from their frequency, no less than from the unobtrusive habits of the actors.  A simple account of such enterprises [that is, Cleveland’s own story], drawn from journals and letters written at the time of the events therein related occurred, is here given to the public. Subtle, right? And, lest you think that the #humblebrag dates from 2011, Cleveland’s account of how he’d thrived against all odds should set you straight: Those who may honor me with a perusal of my narrative will perceive, that I have navigated to all parts of the world, from the sixtieth degree of south latitude, to the sixtieth degree north; and sometimes in vessels whose diminutive size and small number of men caused exposure to wet and cold, greatly surpassing what is usually experienced in ships of ordinary capacity; that i have been exposed to the influence of the most unhealthy places; at Batavia, where I have seen whole crews prostrate with the fever, and death making havoc among them; at San Blas, where the natives can stay only a portion of the year; at the Havana, within whose walls I have resided five years consecutively; that I have suffered captivity, robbery, imprisonment, ruin, and the racking anxiety consequent thereon. And yet, through the whole, and to the present sixty-eighth year of my age, I have taken a drop of spirituous liquor of any kind; never a glass of wine, of porter, ale, or beer, or any beverage stronger than tea and coffee; and, moreover, I have never used tobacco in any way whatever; and this, not only without injury, but, on the contrary, to the preservation of my health. Headache is known to me by name only; and excepting those fevers which were produced by great anxiety and excitement, my life has been free from sickness. And that’s just the preface! You can imagine his conclusion.   Image: mattersofgrey,”Made a new nerd shirt. #humblebrag,” Flickr.com accessed 10-16-2013 Quotations: Richard J.
