While there have always been conventions of marking-up         Classical texts, the study and publication of literary texts have evolved separately from         documentary materials. The corpus of ancient verse is enormously enlarged by the         large number of verse inscriptions found inscribed on stone â€“ principally funerary         verse. Scholarly traditions have made it difficult to look at 'literary' and 'documentary'         verse together. This kind of barrier can perhaps at last be surmounted by the         intelligent use of TEI XML, although tensions will remain.
