Just looking at this image my mouth starts to water. Â Not from an actual desire to eat the cake because, well, its not the best cake. Â My mouth is watering from the memory of partially thawed cakes I ate when I was little. Â In fact, I don’t even think its my mouth thats watering. Rather, 10-year-old me comes to the surface and is eagerly awaiting this birthday treat. A couple of notes regarding how to properly serve this cake. 1) Never let it completely thaw. Â Allow the cake to mostly thaw out, but those center layers should remain slightly frozen. Â Its almost like having a layer of ice cream. 2) Keep the cake on the styrofoam tray. Â In the box is a lovely little square styrofoam tray and you should just use this when you serve the cake. Â No need to dirty a dish. 3) Special occasion? Just add some food coloring to some extra coconut and sprinkle! Â Easy. 4) Serve with ice cream. French Vanilla. The pairing is perfect no further explanation needed. This was never my birthday cake though. It was my grandmother’s birthday cake. Â Her birthday was at the end of July, in the middle of the sweltering summer heat. She didn’t have the patients for the cake to fully thaw. Â She’d let it mostly thaw and then say, “Well…let’s go ahead!” Â She had a way of infusing everything with a sense of mischief and excitement. I was already getting a treat, but the pleasure was compounded because I was eating it before it was “ready.” Oh, the decadence! My grandma loved celebrations. Â Almost any chance or excuse to have people over, put up some decorations, and use a noise-maker-she was in! Â When I was little I just thought she was fun and a little whacky. Â I didn’t understand (and wasn’t supposed to) the connection between her being sick and her desire to celebrate life. Â Not only did she celebrate each holiday and birthday with gusto, she infused that joy and love into my soul. And I am so grateful to her.
