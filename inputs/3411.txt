The following is a spreadsheet I developed to track the requirements for my PhD in History at George Mason University and my completion of the courses. The spreadsheet automatically updates to provide a tally of completed and remaining credits at the bottom. You simple add courses in the slot that they fulfill, and mark when they are completed. The sheet will do the rest. The sheet works best in Microsoft Excel because it was developed and formatted using that software.
