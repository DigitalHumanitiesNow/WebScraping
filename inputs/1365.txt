My buddy James Halabuk, also a history PhD student at George Mason, has started a blog called Just So You Know. His first post, TV as RorschachÃÆ? expands on his believe "that you could tell a lot about somemone by looking at their record collection (update: iPod playlist), knowing what they watch on television or at the movies, or by looking at their bookshelves." Indeed, my friend. In that spirit, here are a few of my favorites:  Movies  Memento -- Basically about a guy trying to avenge the murder of his wife, but the guy suffers from short-term memory loss. Meaning he forgets things fifteen minutes after they happen.  Snatch -- Probably the only Guy Ritchie-directed movie I like, and it's one of those rare movies starring Brad Pitt that I like.  The Matrix Trilogy -- I didn't like the third movie as much as the first two, but a great set of movies. The anime series is also great.  Books  Joseph Heller's Catch-22 -- I have a place in my heart for Yossarian, the main character.  Nancy Cohen's Murder of Helen Jewett -- In quite possibly the most entertaining, most well-researched history monograph that I've ever read, Cohen investigates the sensationalized murder of a New York prostitute in the nineteenth century.  TV Shows  America's Funniest Home Videos -- Yup, I watch it every chance I get. There's nothing funnier to me than  people acting totally foolish and clueless.  Seinfeld -- I tend to identify with George. There's always some really important detail that I miss that makes something go wrong during my day, or some assumption I have that is completely wrong.  Band of Brothers -- It's really a miniseries instead of a TV show, but that's one reason why I like it. Based on Stephen Ambrose's book of the same title.
