How would we design a university if we were starting one today? This and many other thought-provoking questions were among the topics of discussion at the close of the first day of TLISI. The goal of the showcase was to explore the various forms of experimentation and educational initiatives taking place around the university. Participants in the showcase were asked to navigate an inner circle of Designing the Future(s) projects that are re-imagining the future of higher education. An outer circle encouraged participants to post ideas, questions, and comments on topics such as: the possibilities of movingÂ beyond a one-size-fits-all semester; rethinking the end result of four years of college; and replacing majors,Â minors, and certificates. Participants engaged with leaders of feature projects including: the BA/MA in Social Justice Communication, Challenges in Childhood and Society, the iTag initiative, Studio Collaborative, Writing, Design and Communications Minor, and Digital Badging. Highlights included innovative cross-departmental collaborations between the Center for Social Justice (CSJ), the School of Continuing Studies (SCS) and the Main Campus, as well as collaborations between bioethics, rhetoric, and public policy. Many projects showcased project-based, student-driven course designs that are pushing the boundaries of higher education and encouraging students to build 21st century skill sets. CNDLS wishes to extends its sincerest thanks to the Red House for generously hosting an incredible social hour.
