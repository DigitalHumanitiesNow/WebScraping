 I grant you â no pun intended â that the image there is probably the least Flash-y image of Barry Allen I could find online, but I assure you that youâll enjoy the hour-and-a-half Amanda, Arturo and I spent talking about the CWâs hit series. We covered all the angles as only the three of us could â meaning that Amanda and Arturo said very smart things about race and class and gender while I just cursed once in a while to remind people I exist and how I roll. In all seriousness, though, I hope you enjoy listening to this as much as we did producing it. Download and listen to the podcast here.
