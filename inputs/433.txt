I was in Powell’s Books in Portland Oregon today, basking in the warmth of all of those books and all of the people basking in the warmth of all of those books and bookish people.  I couldn’t remember the author of the book that I was looking for, but I knew the title.  There was a line in front of the nearest computer screen.  So I pulled out my iPhone, went to the Amazon.com app, and looked it up.  And bought a very nice used copy.  Just like the good old days only different.
