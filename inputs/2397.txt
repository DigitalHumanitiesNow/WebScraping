   <p>Today my dissertation advisor from Yale gave a presentation at CU. It was part of the music theory &amp; musicology colloquium series, and the computer science colloquium series. It was an engaging talk, and it was great to see such a mix of musicians and computer scientists taking an interest. Here are some photos from the colloquium.</p>  <p><a href="/media/iq/iq4.jpg"><img src="/media/iq/iq-4.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>  <p><a href="/media/iq/iq3.jpg"><img src="/media/iq/iq-3.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>  <p><a href="/media/iq/iq2.jpg"><img src="/media/iq/iq-2.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>  <p><a href="/media/iq/iq1.jpg"><img src="/media/iq/iq-1.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>    <p><a href="http://kris.shaffermusic.com/2014/11/ian-quinn-presents-at-cu/">Ian Quinn presents at CU</a> was originally published by Kris Shaffer at <a href="http://kris.shaffermusic.com">Kris Shaffer</a> on November 20, 2014.</p>
