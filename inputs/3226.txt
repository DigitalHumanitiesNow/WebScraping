Following on from the quick post on my thoughts last week, I’ve put together a Storify archive of the tweets from The Connected Past 2014 network and complexity science meeting with a little commentary included. I enjoyed the conference and found it very inspiring, so I’m happy to collate some of the tweets which hopefully give you a little taste of what was discussed. If you’re interested in more information many of the slides are now up on Figshare, courtesy of the authors and the conference organiser, Tim Evans (Imperial). The meeting came out of the Connected Pasts community, so keep your eyes out for similar things in the future; I am definitely hoping there will be more meetings in the not-so-distant future! Until Storify talks properly with WordPress I’ve put the bare-bones html below: if you want the more attractive full Storify experience, go over to the site. Otherwise, enjoy! The Connected Past 2014// app:        Storify byRuth FT Thu, Sep 18 2014 19:32:43   Edit The Connected Past 2014 Connected Past 2014 was a one and a half day multi-disciplinary meeting exploring how concepts and techniques from network and complexity science can be used to study archaeological data. It took place Monday 8th September and Tuesday 9th September at Imperial College London.

This included an hour or so talk introducing key concepts in network science, followed by an hour or so of working through a tutorial Tom put together on Cytoscape, utilising some nice data from Spain during the pre and Roman period.

Whilst the majority of people were archaeologists, there were a few historians, geographers and a scattering of scientists. The papers in the afternoon saw a wider audience, incorporating a substantial number of computer scientists and physicists, but both showed the international nature of the meeting, attracting people from across Europe and the Americas.

Mon, Sep 08 2014 13:23:32 ReplyRetweetFavorite          After an introduction from Tim, Francesca Fulminante (Cambridge University) presented a paper coauthored with Sergi Lozano and Luce Prignano on Networks and Urbanization in central Italy (1175/1150-500 BC ca). This introduced something of a theme for the meeting, which featured several papers presenting archaeological data which had been analysed by scientists, and in some cases inevitably fell into the trap of downplaying the uncertainty and complexity of the archaeological data.
