Figure 1: Prof Melissa Terras on PanoptiCam   PanoptiCam is a new project running a surveillance camera on Jeremy Bentham’s cabinet in the university’s South Cloisters: Seeing Jeremy Benthamâs auto-icon can evoke a wide array of emotions from surprise and shock to mirth. PanoptiCam captures people’s reaction using a webcam mounted above the auto-icon, with the camera feed posted to our website in real time, and time lapse photography generating days in the life of Jeremy Benthamâs current, yet eternal, viewpoint. We’ve rounded up a few captures and provided a bit of background on the project logo. There is a Twitter feed for project news and another for hourly scheduled captures. PanoptiCam has been noted in a few articles from around the world: 17 Mar 2015: E.
