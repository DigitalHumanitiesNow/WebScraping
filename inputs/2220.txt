Interesting news for historians of digital culture. I had no direct knowledge of this game. I want to learn more about it.WanderÂ was probably the first computer game that is recognisable as what came to be known as a âtext adventureâ (or âinteractive fictionâ) â pre-dating evenÂ ADVENTÂ (a.k.a.Â Colossal Cave) by Crowther and Woods! ButÂ WanderÂ was more than that because it seems to have been designed to be a tool to allow users to create ânon-deterministic fantasy storiesâ[1]Â of their own. So perhaps it would be more accurate to say thatÂ WanderÂ was in fact the earliest known precursor to modern interactive-fiction development-systems likeÂ InformÂ 7! —Retroactive Fiction.
