  Hey y'allâI’m back at MIT for year two of graduate school. And boy do I have some exciting things coming up this semester: I’ll be continuing my work as a research assistant for HyperStudio, MIT’s lab for the digital humanities. Exciting newsâwe just released Annotation Studio 2.0! AnS is a web app that supports close reading and collaborative annotation. Check it out. This year, I’ll be devoting much of my efforts to working on my thesis, Museum Making: Creating with New Technologies in Art Museums. Head over to my research blog for more on the topic. I’m a part of the Creative Communities Initiative, a growing research group at MIT that uses ethnographic methods to study social media, online networks, and “real life” collectives. I’m helping organizing Hacking Arts, a three-day event at the intersection of arts and technology. Join us on October 3-5 for live performances, panel discussions, and a hackathon. Because it wouldn’t be MIT without a hackathon. AlsoâI’m now officially certified to take out the gosh-darn cute Tech dinghies out on the Charles River. Now who ever would let me do that??
