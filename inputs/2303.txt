We're looking for grad students to join us in the D-Lab this Spring. If you feel inspired to help fellow researchers and students learn about and work with data analysis methods and tools, we're interested in hiring you. Â We are the Social Sciences Data Laboratory (D-Lab). We have an open, inclusive culture that values diversity and open exchange. We'll let you develop leadership in a particular area while working collaboratively with other students and staff. Â Our needs tend to fall into three categories, described below. 1. Â Services Team. These positions are usually filled with a 25% to 50% appointment. Â We may be able to offer fee remission with 50% appointments. Â Graduate students in these roles will work in a combination of the following areas: Training, services, and outreach.Â Plan workshops and trainings, recruit and interview instructors, coordinate working groups, reach out to departments, run our user analytics. Communications. Broad portfolio with specializations including website (Drupal), social media, graphic design, communications writing, photography, documentation, and ethnography. Support our development and outreach efforts. Technology infrastructure and tool development. Tell us what you think we should be building, help us develop use cases and advocate across campus. We're particularly interested if you have experience with IPython Notebook, other open-source options for reproducible and collaborative research, or the Berkeley Data Analytics Stack (BDAS).Â  We're also always on the lookout for grad students who can teach their hard-won skills to other researchers. We'll interview you, support you, and embed you in an energizing environment. 2. Â Consultants. We're looking for one-on-one support across the tools/methods/data spectrum. Join ourÂ rosterÂ of active consultants.Â 2-4 hours/week. 3. Â Workshop instructors. As always, we invite you to propose workshops and trainings.
