In the spirit of Mark Sample’s list of digital humanities events at the MLA, here’s a list of digital history panels at the upcoming AHA: Friday, January 2nd Getting Started in Digital History Workshop  Friday, January 2, 2015: 9:00 AM-12:00 PM Conference Room E (Sheraton New York, Lower Level) Our Getting Started in Digital History workshop last year brought historians with an interest in using digital tools and resources together with experts in a range of digital-history methodologies. This year, weâre providing another round of introductory overview sessions, but weâre also expanding the workshop to include intermediate hands-on workshops. For all of our attendees, we have an overview of digital history as a whole and the state of digital history funding, and a brief look at the importance of collaboration and project management in digital history. Jennifer Serventi of the NEHâs Office of Digital Humanities will talk about the work that the ODH does to support digital scholarship. There will also be introductory sessions on preparing research data for digital history projects, making use of various digital tools and methodologies to ask new research questions, building and managing the collaborative aspects of digital history, and using digital tools in the classroom and in public-history endeavors. If you have a little experience but need some hands-on help to get your digital history project kickstarted, we have several sessions that focus on a single methodology and tool set. If youâre interested in big data applied to primary sources, we have workshops on text mining, network theory and visualization, and historical GIS and spatial history. For historians focused on collaborative efforts, we also have hands-on sessions for project sustainability and management, and teaching with digital tools. The workshop is free, but space is limited, so please sign up when you register for the annual meeting. We look forward to seeing you there.   AHA Session 2 – Teaching and Learning the Great War in the Digital Age  Friday, January 2, 2015: 1:00 PM-3:00 PM Beekman Parlor (New York Hilton, Second Floor)   Chair: Lynn Rainville, Sweet Briar College   Panel: Katie Gulledge, Cary Academy (North Carolina) Jamie Lathan, North Carolina School of Science and Math Samantha Shires, Virginia Tech Â  AHA Session 42 – Digital Tools: From the Archive to Publication  Friday, January 2, 2015: 3:30 PM-5:30 PM Beekman Parlor (New York Hilton, Second Floor)   Chair: Leah Weinryb Grohsgal, independent scholar   Panel: Nancy Brown, Purdue University Rachel Kantrowitz, New York University Ashley Sanders, Michigan State University Nora Slonimsky, City University of New York, Graduate Center Â  Saturday, January 3rd Â  AHA Session 69 – Doing More with Less: The Promise and Pitfalls of Short-Form Scholarship in the Digital History Age  Saturday, January 3, 2015: 8:30 AM-10:00 AM New York Ballroom East (Sheraton New York, Third Floor)   Chair: Kristin Purdy, Palgrave Macmillan   Panel: Kristin Purdy, Palgrave Macmillan Kathryn Nasstrom, University of San Francisco Ben Railton, Fitchburg State University Stephanie Westcott, George Mason University Â  AHA Session 95 – Digital Pedagogy for History: Lightning Round  Saturday, January 3, 2015: 10:30 AM-12:00 PM Conference Room D (Sheraton New York, Lower Level)   Chair: Mark Tebeau   Using the “lightning round” method of spreading ideas in the digital humanities, this experimental panel features one-minute expositions on innovative projects and cool ideas in digital history for teaching and learning.
