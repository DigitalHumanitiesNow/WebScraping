   TheÂ Open Society Foundations‘ Mapping Digital Media programme has been mapping the macro framework relevant to this micro exploration — the state, conditions and challenges of digital media landscapes in some 55 countries. The US report was published early on in 2011, the Swedish report a while ago as well, and the India report — Â yesterday. Â (A project to produce the Finnish report has just received funding from the Helsingin Sanomat Foundation!) How can these reports inform the micro-level, personal or personalized reflections of this project? First, the basic figures of internet and mobile phone penetration tell us a lot. What chart might represent what country?          And yet, looking at the conclusions of these studies, one issue become clear: Digitalization does not bring diversity — unless we explicitly demand it and work for it, as citizens, content-creators, consumers. Another contradiction: Infinite possibilites – more of the same. From the SWE report: Pluralism of voices in the media is variable. On the one hand, UGC on digital platforms is increasingÂ dramatically, both on social media and on news media websites. Th us, the number of voices is increasing andÂ more citizens are participating in public debate. On the other hand, there is still a considerable dominationÂ by elite sources in the most important news outlets. This pattern has not changed, despite the contradictoryÂ trend on digital media platforms. From the USA report: Most people now have access to more information than at any previous time, but the decimation of traditionalÂ print and broadcast newsrooms and a lack of viable methods for ï¬nancing in-depth reporting in the digitalÂ age means the nation is at a delicate moment in communications, news, journalism, and free speech. It alsoÂ unfortunately remains the case that race, gender, income, education, geography, age, disability, and sexualÂ orientation all continue to unjustly shape Americansâ opportunities for both accessing and being representedÂ in high-quality reporting.Â … Simultaneously, the digital revolution has upset old business models. As a consequence, there exists aÂ loomingâthough not certainâmarket failure in the production and circulation of publicly relevant news,Â especially at the local level. Traditional media are scrambling to maintain balance in the new environment,Â but have been slow to adapt. From the India report: The multiplicity of television channels within a language marketÂ has not led to signiï¬cant diversity; visible variations in content are more a reï¬ection of diï¬ erences in theÂ dominant interests driving or owning these channelsânamely, politicians and political parties, businessÂ ventures associated or aï¬liated with political groups, and diï¬erent sections within the business community.Â In short, the visible diversity, especially across television news channels, indicates a variety of dominantÂ voices.Â
