Big changes have been happening recently, which if things go well I'll post about soon. And no, the big changes have nothing to do with my work on minor field statements, major field readings, and web design projects, and even less to do with Virginia Tech losing another danged football game, to Florida State of all things. At least the Colts are undefeated.  The Thanksgiving holidays were swell. Jill and I visited our parents. I took a few pictures of Justin, my aunt, and myself hanging up some Christmas decorations. The food was great. My aunts, mother, mother-in-law, and grandmother-in-law are great cooks.  Meant to put this link up a while back.
