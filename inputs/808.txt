This presentation from CNI’s spring 2015 meeting covers efforts at the libraries at Georgia State University (Bryan Sinclair & Joseph Hurley) and the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill (Jill Sexton) to implement immersive display technologies that allow unmediated patron access and reduce the amount of staff time required to support the technologies. Georgiaâs newly-opened CURVE: Collaborative University Research & Visualization Environment features the latest visualization technologies, including an immersive, 24-foot-wide âinteractWallâ for up-close interaction and engagement with digital content. UNC Chapel Hillâs Research Hub supports technology-enabled, interdisciplinary research, providing consulting, software, and equipment for data visualization, data management, GIS services, makerspaces, and digital humanities. The Hub features the Liquid Galaxy, a large display used to visualize geospatial data. Visualization on the Big Screen: Hands-on Immersive Environments Designed for Student and Faculty Collaboration is now available online:  and on Vimeo: https://vimeo.com/126524249 Visit CNI’s video channels on YouTube (http://www.youtube.com/cnivideo) and Vimeo (http://vimeo.com/channels/cni) to see all videos available from CNI.
