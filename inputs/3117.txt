I hope your 2014 Â is full of museumgoing and critical reflection on history! In the new year, may I suggest that the NCPH members among my readers vote in the NCPH board elections? Â You should have received an email in December with voting information. Â The election closes on Jan 5 and I am running for nominating committee. Â  I’d appreciate your support.
