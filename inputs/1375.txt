Jonathan Dresner has composed a great History carnival this time around. Go check it out. Putting the submissions into conference panels is especially nice.  A draft of THE PAPER is due this Thursday. Dr. Zagarri liked my introduction, so that's boosted my confidence in the project. Once I finish the project I plan to put the paper somewhere on the site, perhaps in an effort to practice what I preach. We'll see how that goes.
