This one will be brief as I’m beat.  This morning, they tried to “cork” me, which is what it sounds like.  You put a “cork” in the trach tube to force beeathing through the nose and mouth only.  I had a hard time breathing out–probably because my trach is still pretty big.   Later in the day I was “taped” — an imperfect solution but more practice for corking than anything.  I’ll spare you the details but it was a difficult and I’m pretty sore. Here’s hoping tomorrow’s corking goes better.
