OpenEdition Press has recently published MÃ©moire et nouveaux patrimoines (Portuguese edition: MemÃ³ria e novos patrimÃ´nios), the inaugural titles of its bilingual series BrÃ©sil / France â Brasil / FranÃ§a. This twin publication is the result of collaboration between French and Brazilian research teams. The texts, originally written alternately in Portuguese and French, have been translated and then published in full in both languages. Edited by CÃ©cile Tardy and Vera Dodebei, this first title brings together fifteen academics to examine issues such as the making of heritage, social memory and memorialisation. The first, theory-based section presents the academicsâ points of views on the issues and compares their approaches to the relationship between social memory and heritage designation. The second section presents a series of six case studies, which aim to show in concrete terms how the memory/heritage relationship is at play in Brazilian and French society. The publication is aimed both at readers in the humanities and social sciences (academics, teachers and students) who are interested in the issue of social memory and heritage, and at professionals working within the spheres of heritage development and memory. Four other titles will be published in 2015, again with twin French and Portuguese editions.
