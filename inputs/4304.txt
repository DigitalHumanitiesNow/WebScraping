April is National Poetry Month, and in honor of this several events have popped up. There are some great projects you can do with your students and today happens to be Poem in Your Pocket day and in the spirit of this I would like to share with you a poem I found on http://celebratepoetry.tumblr.com/ a Tumblr where you can submit your own work.That Ache, [Australia].Poem submission by E.K.MerrickThat ache for the sound of the rain on a tin roof,to be held tight during a summerâs storm,or lie awake in each otherâs sweat on ahumid Sydney night.Familiar voices, horizons like the scars on my handsand that soothing lick of a language.That ache to drive north on the Pacific, speeding away fromthe harbour and lights. And for an hour,thereâs nothing,nothing,but the gums and the great expanse of the Hawkesbury.And that ache to go back to those small coastal placesthat define us more than we want to admit.These places that we flee from, for fear that their ripswill drag us down and coerce us to stay in the sea,a life lived as it always has been.But itâs in these places to fall into thearms of people loved forever,despite our ever-shifting and contrasting landscapes.And itâs these small coastal places that soothes this ache,And itâs there to return home to, smiling.
