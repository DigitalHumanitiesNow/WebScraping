No one can have failed to notice that cyber and information security are big areas of concern at the moment.Â                     With high profile incidents affecting companies and governments, we know this is also very high on the agenda in universities, and college organisations. With this in mind, last year we undertook a security products and services strategy consultation. [#pullquote#]we have recently visited a number of you to ensure Jisc’s security products and services meet your requirements[#endpullquote#]As a follow up, we have recently visited a number of you to ensure Jisc’s security products and services meet your requirements. And that current developments and work will help your information security needs.What does this mean for you?Our revised strategy will lead to new and enhanced services to help protect our Janet network, the internet connection we provide to UK colleges and universities, and help you protect your networks, data assets and users.Other new areas of work that have come out of the strategy include:Investigating how best to mitigate denial of service attacks to ensure secure and reliable network access for usersLooking to increase the visibility of threats on our Janet network to help increase securityDeveloping enhanced vulnerability information and assessment services.Helping you inform your communityAnother key area of work involves increasing the awareness of information security and ensuring the benefits of good security are understood at all levels within an organisation.[#pullquote#]we will be investigating how improved security can help you achieve your strategic objectives[#endpullquote#]To do this we will be investigating how improved security can help you achieve your strategic objectives – so, not just investing in security solutions to stop bad things happening, but looking at what business benefits increased security can bring. For example, demonstrating you have a number of security controls in place could help encourage more research collaborations with industry as companies can be sure their intellectual property is well protected, while implementing a virtual private network (VPN) will increase both your security and productivity as staff can work more securely from anywhere.What else are we doing?Jisc is working with a number of institutions to pilot additional controls and safeguards for researchers working with sensitive data. The safe share project will demonstrate secure connectivity at an agreed assurance level over a high volume, encrypted overlay across the Janet network. This means that rather than research programmes developing their own solutions to manage secure access to data, Jisc is piloting a secure connection between partner organisations so that approved researchers working in one of these organisations can securely gain access to the data they need at a remote partner site.Talk to usIf you would like to discuss your security needs and what we can provide, contact our information security liaison co-ordinator Frances Burton on frances.burton@jisc.ac.uk.Jisc also provides a number of targeted courses on different aspects of security, including computers, privacy and the law; information security policies; and managing IT security. For more information see the training section of the Janet website.
