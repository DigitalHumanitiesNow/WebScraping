I intend to discuss how the scholia to the Odyssey of Homer can be encoded in order to be part of a digital edition of the first book of the Odyssey, with special concern for their critical apparatus, starting with an analysis of how a printed edition of the scholia works. I will take into account the possibility of using the Open Source Critical Edition methodological framework for my work on the Odyssey, and the specific characteristic of the Homeric text, its oral origin and the Homeric question on the existence or non existence of Homer.
