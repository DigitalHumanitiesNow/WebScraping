Heritage for Peace: Damage NewsletterHeritage for Peace is a  non-profit organization whose mission is to support all Syrians in  their efforts to protect and safeguard Syriaâs cultural heritage during  the armed conflict.As an international group of heritage  workers we believe that cultural heritage, and the protection thereof,  can be used as a common ground for dialogue and therefore as a tool to  enhance peace. We call on all Syrians of any religion or ethnicity to  enter into a dialogue and work together to safeguard their mutual  heritage.Damage Newsletter â 16 May 2015 (opens as new webpage)Damage Newsletter â 26 April 2015 (opens as new webpage)Damage Newsletter â 02 April 2015 (opens as new webpage)Damage Newsletter â 08 March 2015 (opens as new webpage)Damage Newsletter â 19 February 2015 (opens as new webpage)Damage Newsletter â 02 February 2015 (opens as new webpage)Damage Newsletter â 17 January 2015 (opens as new webpage)Damage Newsletter â 21 December 2014 (opens as new webpage)Damage Newsletter â 02 December 2014 (opens as new webpage)Damage Newsletter â 17 November 2014 (opens as new webpage)Damage Newsletter â 01 November 2014 (opens as new webpage)Damage Newsletter â 14 October 2014 (opens as new webpage)Damage Newsletter â 28 September 2014 (opens as new webpage)Damage Newsletter â 14 September 2014 (opens as new webpage)Damage Newsletter â 31 August 2014 (opens as new webpage)Damage Newsletter â 17 August 2014 (opens as new webpage)Damage Newsletter â 03 August 2014 (opens as new webpage)Damage Newsletter â 20 July 2014 (opens as new webpage)Damage Newsletter â 05 July 2014 (opens as new webpage)Damage Newsletter â 17 June 2014 (opens as new webpage)Damage Newsletter â 01 June 2014 (opens as new webpage)Damage Newsletter â 18 May 2014 (opens as new webpage)Damage Newsletter â 08 May 2014 (opens as new webpage)Damage Newsletter â 27 April 2014 (pdf)Damage Newsletter â 11 April 2014 (pdf)Damage Newsletter â 03 April 2014 (pdf)Damage Newsletter â 26 March 2014 (pdf)Damage Newsletter â 23 February 2014 (pdf)See the full List of Open Access Journals in Ancient Studies
