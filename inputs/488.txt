(this is the second in a series of reflections on the field of history, digital humanities, and historical questions about identity emanating from the 2011 American Historical Association [AHA] conference) In his most recent posting, “The Ivory Tower and Open Web”, historian and director of George Mason University’s Center for History and New Media (CHNM) Dan Cohen shares a video from a recent talk at the Coalition of Networked Information in nearby D.C. where he discussed important questions about the nature of the field of history and its practitioners. At the heart of these questions, Cohen asks why historians (finally?) seem to embrace digital tools as useful resources, but continue to produce (or favor) historical sites that mirror “off-line” scholarship: journals, papers, books, mediated reviews and commentary. The ability to imagine different forms of historical scholarship has permeated much of digital scholarship over the last decade or two. The potential to realize it, though, is now. New digital tools are increasingly making self-publication, remixes & mash-ups, and collaborative efforts (which were largely unimaginable even a decade ago) possible for scholars possessing varying levels of web-literacy. I’m not sure when we crossed the Rubicon in this regard; “old” new media typically entailed curious scholars contacting computerÂ programersÂ for ideas related to research: How can I archive and display images? How can I create interactive footnotes? How do I make a footnote without throwing off the line-height? Nowadays it seems that design principles, knowledge of html and styling sheets, a basic understanding of photoshop, and marketing savvy are all part of the emerging job description of a digital humanist…but the truth is that the glut of digital tools is actually demanding less immersion than early pioneers faced a while back in digital scholarship.  The degree of difficulty “newbie” digital historians face varies, depending on which programs they plan to use. If someone wants to learn how to build a website from scratch, that might be a useful skill to learn (although history graduate students at GMU can attest to this painful process), but…why not simply use WordPress to build a website? Some scholars might want to use an existing template and let the strength of their research sell their website. Others, still, might enjoy hacking and modifying an existing template. The open-source nature of platforms and browsers like WordPress, Firefox, Zotero, and Omeka even allow a few daring scholars to invent new plug-ins that can radically transform what a scholarly site can do. So…what can historians do on the web? At the 2011 AHA conference in Boston I gave a presentation that was, in part, inspired by a recent series of articles by Robert TownsendÂ in AHA’s Perspectives on History (Oct,Â Nov, Dec). In his findings, Townsend noted that scholars are increasingly embracing digital tools based on responses to an extensive survey of over 4,000 members of the academy. Nearly 70 percent of respondents characterized themselves as “active users”-a number that might surprise many. Upon closer inspection, however, active digital users are mostly younger (no surprise here) and the most popular tools are not what many digital historians would necessarily consider as cutting-edge: digital cameras, scanners, search engines, word processors, and searching online archives. Tools that have the potential to change how we “do” history–text mining, social media, GIS/mapping, and data visualizations–received few responses in AHA’s survey. My immediate reaction to Townsend’s articles? Is that it? While acknowledging that my association with CHNM colors any perception about the state of affairs of the field of history, I found it rather underwhelming to see what passes as “digital history” in the second decade of the 21st century. Nevertheless, I am not a utopian when it relates to digital history; lasting change rarely develops out of radical, or revolutionary, change. Any significant shift towards digital scholarship, according to new media scholars like Christine Borgman and digital archivist Daniel Pitti, will appear incrementally as change takes place within existing systems and serves the community as a whole. The presentation at AHA, then, was designed to expose scholars and students of history a sample of the plethora of tools currently at their disposal–free and often open access in nature. As always, these tools are helpful but only when applied with thoughtful consideration towards teaching and research (several good reads recently posted on Edwired deal with the perils and possibilities of web tools) Digital Tools forâ¦PRESENTATIONS Google Maps is a good instrument for examining memorials, battlefields, and other historical sites, while also allowing users to create new and interesting links between locations. Google Earth allows users to create placemarks, polygon shapes, paths, and images on their database of satellite images. This is ideal for creating original maps or recreating routes on military campaigns, plotting the Underground railroad, or analyzing the Great Migration patterns of African Americans to see if new relationships emerge. In ManyEyes, users can upload data and choose visualization preferences that might shed new information about the past Hypercities usesÂ historical overlays on geographic maps to show change over time Prezi isÂ a structural and/or non-structural approach to presentations where you can type text, embed media files, graphically organize items, and highlight the importance of elementsârelative to other ones on the infinite canvas platformâbased on size and colors. The presentation at the AHA conference used a Prezi.   Teaching & Learning History in the Digital Age on Prezi  Digital Tools forâ¦COMMUNICATION Facebook/NING allow users to create network from scratch to imagine what social networking among Bostonian revolutionaries, or suffragettes in the early 20thÂ century might talk about. Multiple other free options exist. Twitter- what would Abe Lincolnâs Twitter feed look like? What about soldiers on the Pacific front in WWII? John Quincy Adams is already on Twitter! Skype helps bridge scholars and institutions together, such as establishing relationships withÂ sister cities and schools overseas. Blogs can become a standard classroom management program (if scholars are not tied to BlackBoard), serve as a professional portfolio, or can help historians re-imagineÂ the possibilities for what scholarship on the web looks like. Zotero, in a nutshell, functions likeÂ digital flash-cards and note-saving device by adding research items from a database (WorldCat works well), allowing users to create notes for each entry, and providing tagging, sharing, and publication functions; Zotero is a helpful tool for collaborative projects and archiving research sources over time. Digital Tools forâ¦PRODUCTION Anthologize puts together an original book or compilation from blogs and other sites across the web Wiki allows users to develop wiki pages for class projects (upload maps, images) or research project items Wordle graphically produces a word-balloon based on text-mining activities, which often reveal interesting insight that is difficult to see in large chunks of text YouTube/Vimeo is aÂ hosting platform for any original video production Picasa/FlickR’s potential as a forum for hosting photo collections (privately orÂ publicly) helps educators and students find visual sources, annotate information, understand copyright laws, and connect images to historical events that are not visible at first (good places to search for images laregly i n the public domain include theÂ Creative Commons search engine,Â Library of Congress,Â National Archives,Â NY Public Library Digital Collection, and the Smithsonian) iMovie/MovieMaker puts users in the driver’s seat in usingÂ images, text, music, and voice-overs–simple elements of a digital storytelling project–to create original documentaries or short-films Animoto is aÂ simple tool that uses images, uploaded with music and text, to create interesting small videos Digital Tools forâ¦MISCELLANEOUS TASKS- Mindmeister/FreeMind/OmniGraffle creates graphic organizers for study, for lesson/unit plans, and many of them can be placed online for collaborative work Gaming isÂ an untapped potential as a teaching tool; see:Â MissionUS,Â Do I Have a Right? (icivics.org),Â BBC History Games,Â Playinghistory.org (a good collection of games) Diigo provides a way to annotate the web (highlight, post-it notes). It can be added to your browser toolbar and, as long as you are logged in, notes will always appear as you re-visit the page. With such a long list, but one that barely touches the surface of what scholars can do with new media, it is easy to see that free and open-access tools are readily found online; but, as one older historian asked me: where can I find these tools? By and large, scholars are hesitant to seek out new technology. The issue is not necessarily a lack of will, rather many simply don’t know what (or where) to search–a pretty common feeling that was expressed during the conference. My presentation aimed at closing that gap in a small way. The larger issue for the academy deals with legitimacy. A casual conversation with a fellow doctoral student at John Hopkins convinced me that major concerns with new media in academic history–legitimacy, upsetting the status quo, tenure, publications, and job security–have hit a snag of sorts. On one side, naysayers and cautionary historians share a laundry list of concerns about legitimacy with no solutions in sight. On the other side, digital historians seem resigned to beating their heads against a wall of despair at the snail’s pace of change in the academy. Instead of looking at why digital scholarship is problematic for tenure and “legitimate” scholarship, perhaps we are better served by looking at existing models widely embraced by scholars that can bridge the digital divide. I have a few ideas worth exploring, but they require more careful thought. Still, I was encouraged that interesting proposals have an ability to raise new questions and foster renewed dialogue…rather than frustration on both sides of the digital (history) divide.
