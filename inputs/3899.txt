I write occasionally for other outlets besides my blog. Â Hey, some of them are even academic papers!  People have been asking me for a selection so here you go. Blog pieces elsewhere relating to Turkey and analyzing recent events: Networked Politics from Tahrir to Taksim: Is there a Social Media-fueled Protest Style?Â : Â Analyzing the commonalities, strengths and weaknesses of social-media fueled protests around the world. Be Quiet and Donât Move So You Can Be HeardÂ : Analyzing how and why the “Standing Man” / “Duran Adam” protests in Turkey came to be.  Academic papers on social media and social movements: Social Media and the Decision to Participate in Protest: Observations from Tahrir Square: Â Multivariate and theoretical analysis of a media use and political participation survey (N=1050) of protesters who took part in Tahrir square demonstrations of early 2011. (With Christopher Wilson) “Not This One”: Social Movements, the Attention Economy, and Microcelebrity Networked Activism: An examination of the “attention economy” and social movements that starts with conceptualizing attention as a distinct resource, analyzes how existing theories of social movements are altered by decoupling of attention and mass media and concludes with a case study from Bahrain as well as examples mostly from Arab Spring countries. Occupying the Political: Occupy Wall Street, Collective Action, and the Rediscovery of Pragmatic Politics: A comparison of NAACP-style 20th century activism and Occupy Wall Street style 21st century movements, with special emphasis on the weaknesses of social-media fueled activism when it comes to strategic political action. (With Daniel Kreiss). Also, let me repost two very early pieces that remain relevant. Delusions Aside, The Net’s Potential is Real: This is a pre-Arab Spring piece which responds to Evgeny Morozov’s first book, the Net Delusion, which I thought made some good points and included important corrections to some of the existing hype but also missed the big picture about the Internet’s potential (and was too Internet-centric, in my opinion, and conflated other structural failures with weaknesses of Internet’s impact on social movements ). I am happy to say I stand by my pre-Arab Spring review and feel like history has played out largely in favor of my arguments (though as I make clear in the review, I do not disagree with everything Mozorov said in the Net Delusion). What Gladwell Gets Wrong: Â This responds to Malcolm Gladwell’s article in the New Yorker which argued that Internet was not useful for social movements because it was mostly good for weak ties, and because social movements can only flourish from strong ties. I argued then that Gladwell suffers from not understanding the Internet, social movements, or how social ties operate, weak or strong. That one can almost pass without comment now (except to say that Malcolm Gladwell’s has a strong Igon Value Problem); however it is a good reminder of how primitive –and wrong– some discussion on the topic of social movements were just a few years ago.
