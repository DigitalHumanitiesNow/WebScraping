If the Internet did exist, we’d have to uninvent it: “It seemed that in their minds, the Internet did not exist; only Facebook.”  Those poor people in developing countries don’t know about the Internet, only Facebook.  Of course Babycastles, my main link to poetry & digital media in NYC, keeps a calendar of events only on Facebook, not on a plain Web page.  I’ve found it very difficult to find (open, public) poetry events in NYC because many are announced only on Facebook.  I’m at an LA poetry festival now. Didn’t know about my friends’ (public) offsite readings; they are Facebook-only.  So, really the joke’s on me for thinking that the Internet still exists and not being on Facebook.  Thanks to the 15 of you who will read this on Twitter. It would have been 3, also deluded that the Internet exists, if I’d only blogged it.
