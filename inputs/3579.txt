I’m happy to announce a new special section of the International Journal of Communication, co-edited by Dylan Mulvin and me. Â The section was Dylan’s idea — part pun, part taking a metaphor seriously. Read it here. The International Journal of Communication Publishes a new Special Sectionon Temperature and Media Studies The 21st century will be the century of temperature. As global temperatures rise, polar ice melts, and drought becomes a permanent way of life, temperature has become the single greatest challenge to human life on the planet. Temperature is also a media problem in many ways: from the heat generated by new mediaâwhether in our hands or in giant server farms; to the technologies used to measure, represent, and understand temperature; to the contribution of new media systems themselves to the problem of global warming. But this is not a new phenomenon. For centuries, media and mediation have been at the center of experiments in and beliefs about temperature and its relation to culture, gender, language, and life. Â In this special section, we take the 50th anniversary of Marshall McLuhanâs Understanding Media literally to ask “What are hot and cold media?â âMedia, Hot and Coldâ (guest-edited by Jonathan Sterne and Dylan Mulvin) is a special section of the IJoC, that tackles questions of temperature in media studies. Just as the intersection of media and temperature is hundreds of years old, this special section shows that work on this intersection is already happening. Â âMedia, Hot and Coldâ brings these existing research threads together as a contribution to what promisesâand needsâto be a growing area of study.
