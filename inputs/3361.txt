I am very happy to announce that I’ll be returning to theÂ Berkman Center for InternetÂ and SocietyÂ this next academic year as a fellow. I am both honored and incredibly excited for this opportunity to continue to engage and collaborate with the Berkman community, especially the Youth and Media team. I had such a blast this last year collaborating with Youth and Media on projects focusing on youth privacy, memes, and evaluating youth technology use in developing nations. I also examined and/or had engaging discussions aboutÂ the right to be forgotten with Meg Ambrose, textbook piracy with BodÃ³ BalÃ¡zs,Â engaging students in novel ways with Eric Gordon, open access with Peter Suber, the future of education with Justin Reich, hacker culture with Molly Sauter, information quality with Alison Head, privacy tools with Ryan Budish, and had a really fun time leading members of the Berkman community in statistics and methodology sessions. And that list doesn’t even cover the many fascinating lunchtime talks, fellows hours, and digital identity working group sessions. This coming year, I’ll be finishing my bookÂ Engaging Students through Social Media: An Evidence-Based Approach for Student AffairsÂ being published by Wiley/Jossey-Bass. I’ll also be engaged in a number of fun analytics projects. I’m currently working on a paper analyzing how textbook analytics can help predict student success. I’ll also be using a dataset containing comprehensive data on student technology use in order to build predictive models of student success and academic resourceÂ utilization– it’s an extension of current learning analytics models to include more predictors and therefore to improve predictive ability of these models. Put another way, I’ll be using big data to improve learning analytics.
