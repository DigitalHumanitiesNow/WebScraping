   <p>These are, I think, books and articles that all educators should read. At least, they have been important in developing my philosophy and practices as an educator.

All are available on the open web unless otherwise noted.</p>  <h2 id="critical-pedagogy-and-student-agency">Critical pedagogy and student agency</h2>  <p><a href="http://libcom.org/library/pedagogy-oppressed-paulo-freire"><em>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</em></a>, by Paulo Freire</p>  <p><a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15053159W/Teaching_to_transgress"><em>Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom</em></a>, by bell hooks (trad. book, not open-access)</p>  <p><a href="http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/montessori/method/method.html"><em>The Montessori Method</em></a>, by Maria Montessori</p>  <p><a href="http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/critical-digital-pedagogy-definition/">Critical Digital Pedagogy: a Definition</a>, by Jesse Stommel</p>  <p><a href="http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/beyond-rigor/">Beyond Rigor</a>, by Sean Michael Morris, Pete Rorabaugh, and Jesse Stommel</p>  <p><a href="http://www.cathydavidson.com/books/now-you-see-it/"><em>Now You See It</em></a>, by Cathy Davidson (trad. book, not open-access)</p>  <p><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity">How Schools Kill Creativity</a>, by Ken Robinson</p>  <p><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/sir_ken_robinson_bring_on_the_revolution">Bring on the Learning Revolution!</a>, by Ken Robinson</p>  <p><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_changing_education_paradigms">Changing Education Paradigms</a>, by Ken Robinson</p>  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwslBPj8GgI">Confessions of a Converted Lecturer</a>, by Eric Mazur</p>  <h2 id="social-justice-in-education">Social justice in education</h2>  <p><a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/11/16/from-open-to-justice/">From âOpenâ to Justice</a>, by Audrey Watters</p>  <p><a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10676-014-9351-8">From open data to information justice</a>, by Jeffrey Alan Johnson (paywalled)</p>  <p><a href="http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/maggies-digital-content-farm/">Maggieâs Digital Content Farm</a>, by Audrey Watters</p>  <p><a href="http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/affinity-asynchronous-learning/">An Affinity for Asynchronous Learning</a>, by Maha Bali &amp; Bard Meier</p>  <h2 id="syllabus">Syllabus</h2>  <p><a href="http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/syllabus-manifesto-critical-approach-classroom-culture/">Syllabus as Manifesto: A Critical Approach to Classroom Culture</a>, by Adam Heidebrink-Bruno</p>  <p><a href="http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/envisioning-radical-syllabus-critical-approach-classroom-culture-part-2/">Envisioning the Radical Syllabus: A Critical Approach to Classroom Culture, Part 2</a>, by Adam Heidebrink-Bruno</p>  <h2 id="reading-and-writing">Reading and writing</h2>  <p><a href="http://learning.instructure.com/2014/03/the-pedagogies-of-reading-and-not-reading/">The Pedagogies of Reading and Not Reading</a>, by Jesse Stommel</p>  <p><a href="http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/learning-let-go-listening-students-discussion/">Learning to Let Go: Listening to Students in Discussion</a>, by Chris Friend</p>  <p><a href="http://learning.instructure.com/2014/06/what-is-good-writing-a-meditation-on-breaking-rules-and-grammar-pedagogy/">What is Good Writing?: A Meditation on Breaking Rules and Grammar Pedagogy</a>, by Jesse Stommel</p>  <h2 id="music">Music</h2>  <p><a href="http://www.flipcamp.org/engagingstudents2/essays/kulmaNaxer.html">Beyond Part Writing: Modernizing the [Music Theory] Curriculum</a>, by Meghan Naxer and David Kulma</p>  <p><a href="http://www.flipcamp.org/engagingstudents2/essays/alegant.html">On âscuba diving,â or the advantages of a less-is-more approach</a>, by Brian Alegant</p>     <p><a href="http://kris.shaffermusic.com/2015/01/essential-reading-on-education/">Essential reading on education</a> was originally published by Kris Shaffer at <a href="http://kris.shaffermusic.com">Kris Shaffer</a> on January 20, 2015.</p>
