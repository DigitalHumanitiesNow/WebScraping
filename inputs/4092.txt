Today the JSR editors (Mike Pasquier, Luke Harlow, Art Remillard, and Emily Clark) published volume 14 of the Journal of Southern Religion. This issue has a great line up of articles, especially the forum on âReligion in the Early Southâ guest edited by Rebecca Goetz. My technical innovation for this issue was generating EPUB and Kindle e-books of the issue. To do so, I used a Ruby program that I coded. The source code is on GitHub, and I released the utility as a RubyGem. I was surprised by how many people downloaded the Gem. Sure, the downloads were not in the tens of thousands, but at least sixty people have downloaded the latest version.
