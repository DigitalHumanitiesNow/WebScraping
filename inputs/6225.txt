   Plato's Philosophers 3 Ways  Originally uploaded by cplong11   For episode 54 of the Digital Dialogue, I am joined via Skype by Catherine Zuckert, Nancy Reeves Dreux Professor of Political Science at the University of Notre Dame.  Professor Zuckert is the author of many on the history of political philosophy and the relationship between literature and politics. I will link to her CV on the blog, but I want to mention a few of her excellent books here in reverse chronological order: Natural Right and the American Imagination: Political Philosophy in Novel Form (Savage, Md: Rowman and Littlefield, 1990), 277 pages. Postmodern Platos:  Nietzsche, Heidegger, Gadamer, Strauss and Derrida (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press, 1996), 351 pages.The Truth about Leo Strauss: Political Philosophy and American Democracy, with Michael P. Zuckert (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2006), 352 pages. But it is her most recent book, Plato's Philosophers: The Coherence of the Dialogues (Chicago UP, 2009) that brings her to the digital dialogue today.  I had the privilege to review the book for the Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews and upon its recent appearance, we thought it would be a wonderful opportunity to engage in a more dynamic discussion of the book together here on the digital dialogue. So, Catherine Zuckert, welcome to the Digital Dialogue.   Digital Dialogue 54: Catherine Zuckert on Plato's PhilosophersTo subscribe to the Digital Dialogue through iTunesU, click here.
