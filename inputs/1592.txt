Â TIME: 2:00 â 3:30 pm, Friday, May 8th, 2015 ROOM: CUNY Graduate Center, Room C415A FOCUS: English & Literary Studies NYC has more graduate students executing projects in the digital humanities than perhaps anywhere else in the world. Even so, few venues exist that make visible the diverse set of methods, philosophies, and inquiries that drive this graduate student work in English Studies. Media Res #1 will present a wide array of approaches to theoretically-informed questions through a series of 12 five-minute lightning talks by graduate students doing student-driven digital humanities research in NYC. These talks and the subsequent discussions the talks engender will serve as a useful entry to point into DH for students who might otherwise not know where to start. Equally important, Media Res #1 will foster a burgeoning network of graduate student scholars working across academic institutions to collaborate on intellectual inquiry, share knowledge and practical expertise in DH, and inspire confidence and mutual support. This event will conclude with a moderated discussion inviting speakers and audience alike to explore how universities might better support and promote ongoing student-driven DH work. While Media Res #1 highlights student DH projects in English and literature, future Media Res events will explore DH work in different disciplines, formats, and venues. Any questions or suggestions for future Media Res events should be directed to Erin Glass (erin.glass@gmail.com) or Aaron Plasek (aaronplasek@gmail.com). Panelists include: Jeffrey Binder (Graduate Center),Â Mary Catherine Kinniburgh (Graduate Center), Patrick Smyth (Graduate Center), Jojo Karlin (Graduate Center), Erin Glass (Graduate Center), Julia Fuller (Graduate Center), Chris Vitale (Graduate Center), Jesse Merandy (Graduate Center), Collin Jennings (NYU), Grace Afsari-Mamagani (NYU), Jon Reeve (NYU), Aaron Plasek (NYU & Columbia), and Christy Pottroff (Fordham).
