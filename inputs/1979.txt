Bodhi Linux Project Leader Stepping Down: First, thank you Jeff.  Bodhi is truly an amazing Linux distro.  Bodhi is one of the best low resource distros available.  It is an Ubuntu spin that smoothly integrates the Enlightenment desktopâ¦â¦Genius.  I used Bodhi to run my academic laptop when I only had very old kit.  I also used it to recycle old laptops for elderly, 1st time computer users.  It allowed me to give away laptops to people who needed them but could not afford to spend hundreds of quid on a fixed budget.  Bodhi is also a study in volunteering.  Many Linx distros are developed and maintained by teams of volunteersâ¦.It seemed Jeff did not have a massive team to share the responsibility of maintaining a global Linux distribution.   In our era of neoliberal common sense and values we often overlook the social and cultural power of a common wealth of information.  It seems the digital commonwealth is shrinking.  It is becoming ever more privatised and closed to public consumption.  In the digital Commonwealth software, is open and malleable, instructions, information and lessons are freely available.  To participate and contribute to the Commonwealth is an act of global, civic responsibility.  Jeff certainly did his civic duty.  Even when our actions are local, participation in the digital commonwealth makes them global.  In our age of neoliberal common sense digital technology and its development is a central focus.  There is a pressing need to be more vigilant in defending and maintaining both the digital commonwealth as well as the  commonwealth of nations.
