I was given a cheap toy helicopter for Christmas that is controlled with a mobile app. Since the helicopter uses bluetooth to communicate, I am hoping to connect my laptop to the device and figure out a way to control it outside of the app. Anyone have experience with bluetooth or device hacking that could let me know if I’m on the right path or hopeless?  I began by pairing the helicopter to my laptop, which I was able to do using the Bluetooth Explorer utility. I collected device info, and posted screenshots on Flickr. What caught my attention was that the device is listed as a headset. I’m not sure what devices like toys are typically listed as, but it appears that the helicopter may be using the bluetooth headset profile for at least some of its communication. And so I jumped to a conclusion which is probably wrong: if I could find a way to simulate or execute the same commands a bluetooth headset does, and successfully connect it to the helicopter, maybe I could control it.  At this point, I see the following paths moving forward:  1) Try to communicate directly with the helicopter, using a bluetooth headset or writing code of my own. (Assumes that I can just use the headset profile) 2) Bluetooth sniffing to monitor the communication between the helicopter and my phone to discern the basic commands being sent. (Assumes that I have no idea how the two devices communicate) 3) Something brilliant that I haven’t thought of. 4) Giving up.  I’m sure there are layers of complexity that I’m not even aware of, but I’m having fun hacking around. Any advice would be great!  Update 12/31/2012: I’m experimenting with using Wireshark to pursue the second path.
