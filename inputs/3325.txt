If you’re an academic, you’ve probably heard about the recent New York Times article covering the decline of humanity majors at places like Stanford and Harvard. As many people have already pointed out, the article is a brilliant example of cherry-picking anecdotal evidence to support an existing narrative (i.e. the crisis in the humanities)âinstead of using, you know, actual facts and statistics to understand what’s going on. Ben Schmidt, a specialist in intellectual history at Northeastern University, has put together an  interactive graph of college majors over the past few decades, using the best available government data. Playing around with the data shows some surprises that counter the prevailing narrative about the humanities. For example,  Computer Science majors have declined since 1986, while  History has remained steady. Ben  argues elsewhere that not only was the steepest decline in the humanities in the 1970s instead of the 2010s, but that the baseline year that most crisis narratives begin with (the peak year of 1967) was itself an aberration. Of course, Ben’s data is in the aggregate and doesn’t reflect trends at individual institutions. But you can break the data down into institution type, and find that  traditional humanities fields at private SLACs like my own (Davidson College) are pretty much at late-1980s levels. Clearly we should be doing more to counter the perception that the humanitiesâand by extension, the liberal artsâare in crisis mode. My own experience in the classroom doesn’t support this notion, and neither does the data.
