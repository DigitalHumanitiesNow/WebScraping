Since the scan last December, my bloodwork has been normal, both for tumor markers and for the level of artificial thyroid hormone in my body. Today is the one year anniversary of my total thyroidectomy. In mid-September I’ll have a (totally routine) one year scan, to check my neck. Which means that from September 1 to 19, I’ll be back on the low iodine diet.Â  I’m not thrilled, especially since we’re edging towards Pumpkin Spice Latte season, but I’m also happier to be doing it at this time of year – late summer/early fall – than in December. I figure I’ll just hit the local and farmers’ market, stock up on interesting vegetables, and eat a large number of salads. I have a quinoa chili recipe I like which I can make, so long as I cook the beans myself ahead of time (which is cheaper anyway) and can find canned tomatoes without salt or soy.Â  I’m in the process of making up a shopping list. If I remember, I’ll post it here.
