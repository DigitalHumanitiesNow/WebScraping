 HGIS Carolina is hosting a Student Showcase today (April 3) from 3:30-5:00p “to allow UNC students to presentÂ their work using GIS to study, reconstruct, and visualize the past.” Â Ross Twele, Ryan Horne, and Michael Heubel will be presenting portions of the Ancient World Mapping Center’s ongoing work on Antiquity Ã-la-carte 3.0 under the title “Mapping the Ancient Mediterranean in the Digital Age.” Â The 20-minute presentation will draw particular attention to our current project of producing individual shapefiles for regional and tribal names, bridges and aqueducts, and centuriation patterns.
