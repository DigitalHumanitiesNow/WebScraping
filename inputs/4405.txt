So, my inaugural lecture is coming up in a few weeks, and I'm starting to write it now, nervously... The event has already sold out, but will be streamed online live, and there is also another lecture theatre at UCL that it will be shown live in (The Terras Terrace?).Â  Dr Rudolf Ammann, UCLDH's designer at large, has kindly provided some visuals for me... here's the promotional flyer.I plan to write the lecture out long hand once it is done, and of course, you will be the first to know about it (after I've given it...)
