Amnesty International has launched its most recent report on Death sentences and executions in 2014. In their annual report they publish the minimum figures of recorded death sentences and executions that they are able to verify. For producing a Worldmapper-style cartogram, absolute numbers are essential of course, which requires some decisions to be made which numbers go into the map transformation. For the following two maps, showing the death penalty executions and sentences in 2014, the minimum figures of validated cases provided in the report were used, or, where these were not stated, the estimated figures as stated in the report were used instead (China was set to 1000 to not dominate the cartogram entirely, even if the number is believed to be much higher than that). The maps therefore need to be seen as a general picture of the state of death penalty in the world, rather than the exact reality. As stated by Amnesty, “the real number of people executed is much higher. There are no figures for China, for example, which is believed to execute more people than the rest of the world put together. Other countries like Belarus also execute prisoners in secret, often without informing the detaineesâ relatives or lawyers.” (click for larger version) The general conclusion of the report finds, that “death sentences increased, while executions decreased“. Amnesty “recorded 607 executions in 22 countries in 2014 – a decrease of 22% compared with 2013. 22 countries carried out executions: the same number as last year.” Regarding the sentences, as shown in the second map below, “55 countries are known to have sentenced at least 2,466 people to death in 2014 â a 28% increase from 2013. This is mainly due to a spike in death sentences in Egypt and Nigeria. By the end of the year, at least 19,094 people worldwide were sentenced to death.”  (click for larger version) The content on this page has been created by Benjamin Hennig using data published by Amnesty International.
