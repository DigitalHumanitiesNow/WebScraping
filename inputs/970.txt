I meant to post this a while back: Two of my favorite things--baseball and XML--are used at The Baseball Analysts to analyze various pitching stats. See, for example, this article discussing the Enhanced Gameday application from MLB.com. Major League Baseball provides XML files of games, albeit in a rather inaccessible form. You'll have to dig deep to find specific games and players, but the stats are there for 2004 to today.   *[XML]: Extensible Markup Language
