   Gathering  Originally uploaded by cplong11   Episode 57 of the Digital Dialogue is a recording of a collaborative lecture I delivered at the University of San Francisco on October 25th, 2012. The lecture focused on Plato and the Politics of Reading, but it also involved an attempt to use twitter to create a community of collaborative reading.  To facilitate this, I set my computer to tweet for me during the lecture and invited those gathered there to follow along and engage the ideas in the lecture via twitter. To see the remarkable results of the conversation that emerged, and to join it yourselves, visit the Storify story I created on Plato and the Politics of Reading. Below are the links to the audio file and to the iTunesU:Digital Dialogue 57: Collaborative Lecture on Plato and the Politics of ReadingTo subscribe to the Digital Dialogue through iTunesU, click here.
