Playing off the "THAT" acronym, CHNM, Digital Campus, and THATPodcast are sponsoring THATCamp. Taking place May 31-June 1, THATCamp is an "unconference" for digital humanities. The event is hosted by the Center for History and New Media, George Mason University. If you have a strong interest in the future of digital humanities and want to participate in something other than a traditional conference, send an email to thatcamp.info@gmail.com stating who you are, what you want to talk about, and what you'd like to get out of the camp. The sign-up deadline for THATCamp is March 15.   [June 1]: 20080602   [CHNM]: Center for History and New Media   *[May 31]: 20080531
