This weekend, I’ve spent a bunch of time thinking about passion–what that means, what it takes, the possibility of sustaining it. What happens when you realize that what you thought was passion for something is merely convenience? Is being passionate about something synonymous with passion itself? Can you be passionate w/o having passion? I know this all sounds messy (which is all it is in my head) and little more than semantics, but I swear there’s something behind this thinking. I know what I need to do, but I don’t know how the hell to start…Â
