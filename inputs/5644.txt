As it happens, I am on leave this semester (for the first time ever), and Iâve basically decided that Iâm going to write software the entire time.  Iâm not quite ready to say what Iâm working on, because some of it involves unfamiliar territory.  For the moment, Iâm mostly reading apis and language manuals.  But even I canât do that all day, and so Iâve been trying to knock off a couple of quick tools that Iâve longed for while working on other things.  The first of these is MorphExtractor.  Here at cdrh, we do a lot of work with MorphAdorner â the amazing program that Phil âPibâ Burns developed when we worked together on the monk project.  Essentially, MorphAdorner takes xml files and tags sentence boundaries and tokens while âadorningâ them with morphological data (part of speech, lemma, etc.)  This is particularly useful to us, since my colleague Brian Pytlik-Zillig can do positively anything with xslt â including build an entire text analysis system using only xslt.  Itâs surely nothing for Brian to hack out any kind of stylesheet he wants in a few seconds, but what I wanted was a grep-like tool that could extract tokens from MorphAdorner files quickly and easily, so I could munge them around and throw them into R, or mallet, or whatever.  I admit there arenât a lot of people in this situation, but for the few who areâ¦  Itâs written in C, and requires only libxml2 and pkg-config.  It should build out of the box on any Linux machine, and on os x with the right dependencies installed via Homebrew or something similar. Iâve labeled it a beta, because I havenât tested it very extensively or built it on a wide variety of platforms, but it appears to be stable and is feature complete.  If autotools is your idea of fun, you can check out the GitHub repo.  autoreconf -i, etc.
