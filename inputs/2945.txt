Hammer and nails by Hans Godo FrabelAlthough Iâll be starting my day with an administrative meeting and hopefully spending the remainder wrapping up a very traditional sort of paper as part of my experiment in writing in public, Iâm also juggling various tasks for the digital projects on this Day of Digital Humanities.1.     Arranging receipt of 3 boxes of archival materials for the first digital archives project Iâll do start to finish with my students2.     Corresponding with co-author of digital history of history of woman suffrage3.     Keeping an eye on the open review of a digital project that went live recently4.     Preparing to teach Intro to DH tomorrow, making the most of the remaining few weeks we have5.     Thinking about digital project advice recently requested by new scholarly acquaintanceIt occurs to me in the three years since I wrote my first Day of DH post that digital work has seeped into every crevice of my professional life.  I made the contact for the archival project via a Skype meeting of my Collegeâs consortium.  I have as many digital research projects in the works as I do traditional projects, and I now teach aspects of digital humanities in all of my classes. I sometimes wonder if Iâve reached my digital saturation point though.  While the more I work digitally, the more digital opportunities I see, I have also noticed the prevalence of pen and paper at digital conferences and I feel that pull of the analog myself, the expensive pen, the leather-bound journal, the more digital work I do.To what extent does the digital humanities lead to that old saw about everything looking like a nail if you are holding a hammer?    I still insist my students work in a paper archive at least once in four years, and encourage them to map out projects that old fashioned way on post-its or index cards if that works for them.  I also stress the need to work physically together at times, as well as collaborate remotely, not because of any ascription to digital dualism, but simply to acknowledge that personal interaction occurs in differ fora and they need to get used to them all.addenda, like more than one other person, I ended up with familial duties on this Day Of DH.  Faced with images on Twitter of the fabulous work spaces others I posted thiswhere the #DH magic happens #slac not a @SLACker here there & everywhere #DayofDH at home, by chance w/sick kid pic.twitter.com/QBSiOsHg4fâ M.M.
