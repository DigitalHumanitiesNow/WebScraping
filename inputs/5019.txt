Whatâs new with you TYBYWYers? Iâm sure youâve been setting the world on fire with your freshly acquired tech skills. Youâve been pushing back the boundaries of the semantic web. Maybe the rumors are true and youâre developing a new app to better serve your users. I have no doubt youâre staying busy. If youâre new to Tech Yourself, let me give you a quick overview. Each installment, produced monthly-ish offers a curated list of tools and resources for library technologists at all levels of experience. I focus on webinars, MOOCs, and other free/low-cost options for learning, growing, and increasing tech proficiency. Welcome! Worthwhile Webinars:  Texas State Library and Archives â Tech Tools With Tine â One Hour of Arduino â May 29, 2015 â Iâve talked about this awesome ongoing tech orientation series before, and this installment on Arduino promises to be an exciting time! TechSoup for Libraries â Excel at Everything! (Or At Least Make Better Spreadsheets) â May 21, 2015 â I will confess I am obsessed with Excel, and so I take every free class I find on the program. Hope to see you at this one!
