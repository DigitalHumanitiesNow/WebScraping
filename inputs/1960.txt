The second laptop of the year, a Dell Inspiron 1525, is now running openbox (via:xubuntu).Â  The laptop was donated as it would not run Windows 7 smoothly on 2 gigs of RAM.Â  I started using Xubuntu 64 bit to write and research. The Laptop is able to run 64 bit Oses but it should have 4 gb of RAM.Â  I only have 2gb.Â  Running Openbox speeds up most operations except Chrome.Â  Firefox is speedy, but ChromeÂ  to see if this old laptopÂ  is not.Openbox looks very nice as it draws from the Xubuntu themes and icons and it is able to run gtk3.Â  I am saving for 4gb to make the most of the 64 bit capabilities and apps.Â  Openbox does rock.Â  I grabbed theÂ  tint2 config from DeviantArt.Â  One may follow this guide for Xubuntu/Openbox. One nerely needs to install Openbox from Synaptic and configure it to your liking.Â  I like to keep the Debian menu item as it displays most of your Xubuntu apps.Â Lastly an Xubuntu/Openbox set up has far less privacy issues than bloated Unity desktops.Â
