A quick update from me: I’m pleased to say I’ve submitted my thesis! My viva isn’t until June, so until then I shall hopefully be catching up with the myriad of things that have been neglected since write-up took over my life. That should mean more time to post here (and get round to updating the site), as well as hopefully more time to write things which are not my thesis. Many thanks to the many communities, online and in real life, who contributed support and discussion, I am very much looking forward to having time to interact properly with you again!
