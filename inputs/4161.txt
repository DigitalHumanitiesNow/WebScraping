I've been working on adding a couple of things to the museum game assessment rubric and included rows to evaluate  juiciness and art. I am struggling with the visual literacy evaluation but, since that may be specific to games for art museums, have made a separate rubric for that which I will discuss later in this post.I think that the quality of the graphics and art is really important and impacts player engagement. I decided to make the values reflect both the quality of the work and how well it helped further the story/game play.Juiciness is a term you might not be familiar with but it refers to how well the game communicates back to the player what is going on. This is another important yet often overlooked aspect of good game design and has a great impact on player engagement. The communication may be visual, by changing graphics or animation for example, or it may be a specific type of sound. Ideally, of course, there would be both.  Think of the feedback you get when you hit a jackpot: flashing lights and bells.  Or the sound and object makes when you interact with it. This is the sort of thing that makes a game juicy.  Excellent  Proficient  Somewhat Proficient  Poor   3  2  1  0 Engagement  age appropriate, highly engaging   and fun  age appropriate, moderately   engaging and fun  age appropriate, somewhat engaging   and fun  not fun, engaging or age   appropriate Feedback  Scoring supports player formative   assessment and learning  Scoring is connected to learning   but unclear or inconsistent  Scoring is not connected to game   play but player is able to see how it could be  Scoring is not connected to   content provides no feedback for player improvement Juiciness (player communication)  graphics/ sound clearly   communicate to the player exactly what is going on  graphics/ sound moderately   communicate to the player exactly what is going on  graphics/ sound somewhat   communicate to the player exactly what is going on  Little to no sound/graphic output   to let player know what is going on Complete, Correct and Well-Rounded   Content  Presents the player with a   complete and balanced set of correct knowledge from the subject area.  Presents the player with an almost   complete, correct and balanced set of knowledge.  Presents the player with some   correct knowledge.  Provides no knowledge or what is   provided is incomplete, incorrect or biased. Focused on the Topic  Consistently stays focused on the   relevant educational topic and associated processes  Focuses on the topic and processes   most of the time. Includes some superfluous content.  Focuses on the topic and processes   some of the time.  Includes a lot of superfluous content.  Content and game play are disconnected   from one another. Integration of game play and   content  Game play is built around the   knowledge and/or processes of the domain and hence highly connected.  Some of the game play is linked to   domain knowledge.  None of the game play is linked to   domain knowledge however the player gets a sense of how it could.  The game play has nothing to do   with the domain knowledge. Encourages Active Player   Participation  Encourages Active Player   Participation  Player must contribute some effort   to progressing through the game and the game encourages these efforts.  Player must contribute very little   effort to progress through the game and the game provides no encouragement to   continue playing.  Player can progress through the   game without any effort (like watching a movie). Problem Solving  The player must actively solve   problems to progress through the game using knowledge and information   gathered from previous game play tasks.  The player must refine solutions   to problems from suggestions given in the game.  The player must select a solution   to a problem from a set of choices given by the game.  The player does not need to solve   problems to progress. Assessment  Evaluating the playerâs domain   knowledge level is directly connected with challenges in the game.  Most of the challenges in the game   test the players knowledge of the domain.  Some of the challenges in the game   test the players knowledge of the domain.  None of the challenges in the game   test the players knowledge of the domain. Art  Visuals and graphics are   attractive and support game play and story  Visuals and graphics are   relatively attractive and support game play and story  Visuals and graphics are not   attractive but support game play and story  Visuals and graphics are not   attractive and do not support the story/gameplay Visual LiteracyMany museums, particularly art museums, are interested in teaching visual literacy. You will often hear museum professionals talk about looking and curators want visitors to come into the museums and look at the objects. Why? Why is the real version better than a digital version? Well, short answer, they really aren't the same (sorry W. Benjamin). Whenever you transfer an image into a different medium, you have to sacrifice something. The colors are not the same for one thing.  When copying a painting to make into postcards, for example, decisions have to be made as to which colors will be the closest to the original and which will be allowed to stray farther away. Texture is another physical quality that doesn't reproduce consistently or well. Images are taken with a fixed light source. However, when we look at an object we are assessing it visually as we move around, from different angles, which allows us to have a different visual understanding of the object. Finally, as I'm sure most of you know, going to the museum binds those objects into a narrative experience, creating visitor specific meaning and context for the objects that will stay with the visitor a lot longer. So, the real object IS important and not just a fetish that allows museum pilgrims to bask it its aura of authenticity (although that happens, too).I think, overall, that museums are asking too little of visitors as far as visual literacy goes. Admittedly, much of the visual literacy is aimed at young visitors but many in-museum games and activities depend on such thought provoking questions as "what colors do you see?" or how many stars are in that painting?" Visual literacy is a lot more than just looking, I would argue it is about thinking. Objects and visual representations are loaded with meaning that we read based on our cultural and socio-economic vocabulary. This is, to me, where the really interesting stuff happens.Visual literacy is really important today as we are bombarded with media images. The Metiri Group developed a useful document that outlines visual literacy as a 21st-century skill.Visual Literacy is the ability to interpret, use, appreciate, and create images and video using both conventional and 21st century media in ways that advance thinking, decision-making, communication, and learning Students Who Are Visually Literate:Have Working Knowledge of Visuals Produced or Displayed through Electronic MediaUnderstand basic elements of visual design, technique,      and mediaAre aware of emotional, psychological, physiological,      and cognitive influences in perceptions of visualsComprehend representational, explanatory, abstract, and      symbolic imagesApply Knowledge of Visuals in Electronic MediaAre informed viewers, critics, and consumers of visual      informationAre informed critics and consumers of visual      informationAre knowledgeable designers, composers, and producers      of visual informationAre effective visual communicatorsAre expressive, innovative visual thinkers and      successful problem solvers(enGuage 21st-century skills)It seems appropriate then that we should start evaluating how well we are trying to teach visual literacy with our objects. Below is my first attempt at a visual literacy for museum games rubric:  Excellent  Proficient  Somewhat Proficient  Poor   3  2  1  0 Looking  Features of the object required   for game, solving puzzles, etc  Features of the object referenced   within the game, for illustration and context  The object is mentioned in the   game  No connection to the real object Emotional  Requires interpretation of the   object  Requires general interpretation of   shape, color  Mentions emotional, psychological   perceptions  Does not mention these perceptions Abstract  Requires deep knowledge of   abstract, representational or symbolic aspects  Requires general comprehension of   abstract, representational or symbolic aspects  Mentions abstract,   representational or symbolic aspects  Requires no comprehension of these   aspects Creating  Requires strong knowledge of   visual design and techniques  Requires some knowledge of visual   design and techniques  Mentions knowledge of visual   design and techniques  Does not mention knowledge of   visual design and techniques Note that this rubric applies to games and interactive media that are meant to be played within a museum or park with the objects. Other game play elements should be assessed as per the first rubric.
