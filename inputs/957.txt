The news is out: We've released Omeka to the public! It's a public beta, dubbed version 0.9.0, but we've made some great progress since the first private invitation release early last Fall. We have lots of exciting work ahead of us, and we're looking forward to building a strong user community and working with that community as we continue developing Omeka. So, go download Omeka and try it out!
