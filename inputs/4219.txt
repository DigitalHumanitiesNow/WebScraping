I swear, I’m the worst blogger in the world.  I used to do this all the time, back when blogs were shiny and new and apparently we all had all the time in the world.  Remember that? 2004 or 2005?  Seems like a million years ago. Anyway, I’m not going to lie—this blog post is an interstitial.   I hate that I’ve allowed my blog to become a place where I say “hey, I have a new job!” (not true) or “hey, I have a new book edition” (not yet true) or “hey, I’m on the job market again” (100% true)  and nothing else really interesting.  I much prefer my blog to be a space where I profess my undying love for StackExchange (still true), talk about great hiring tools like Careers 2.0 (it’s really good), and wax philosophical about unicorns and code review (I really really believe in embedded code review processes!). Maybe now, with some free time on my hands, I’ll join the chorus of people singing the praises of Slack, or I’ll talk about two other SaaS tools that I will try very hard to use wherever I go, should architectures allow: Code Climate (static analysis tool) and Semaphore (continuous integration and deployment).  I also have really positive things to say about TrueAbility, which allows job applicants to show off their skills through some pretty rigorous online testing. Come to think of it, I’m also bullish on General Assembly, which offers immersive programs as well as short-term courses and workshops, and they don’t suck at all.  I guess I have a lot to say about stuff.
