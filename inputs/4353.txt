Some of the digital art history summer institutes from last year are returning for 2015! The Getty has renewed funding for these three institutes:       July 5 â July 15: Beyond the Digitized Slide Library at the University of California, Los Angeles: Participants will learn about debates and key concepts in the digital humanities and gain hands-on experience with tools and techniques for art historical research (including metadata basics, data visualization, network graphs, and digital mapping).â N.B. current graduate students are not eligible to apply. Applications are open now, and due March 1st.           July 6 â July 16: Beautiful Data II at Harvard University: âWith art museums making both their imagery and collections data open and accessible, a question arises: what to do with it all? Participants will be introduced to concepts and skills necessary to make use of open collections to develop art-historical storytelling through data visualization, interactive media, enhanced curatorial description and exhibition practice, digital publication, and data-driven, object-oriented teaching.â Applications are open now, and due March 1st.           July 13 â July 24: Building a Digital Portfolio at George Mason University: âParticipants will learn from experienced RRCHNM and GMU faculty whose expertise span a range of digital humanities methodologies. Together with returning Project Co-Directors, Sheila Brennan and Sharon Leon, are Lisa Rhody, Stephanie Westcott, Lincoln Mullen, and Michele Greet.â N.B.This institute is specifically open to students pursuing MAs or PhDs in art history. Applications open February 9th.    Obviously, Iâm glad to update this post with any other summer programs that seem relevant.
