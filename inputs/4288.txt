The MGB project is officially re-igniting, inspired by the American Historical Association’s Annual Meeting in New Orleans. This years’ AHA meeting in NOLA is particularly tantalizing for the MGB project, as New Orleans was the site of the Plessy v Ferguson case that initiated the segregation of travel that defined the landscape of The Green Book. A number of intriguing panels are on the schedule and I’ll be posting on a few sessions related to race, landscape and the Jim Crow era from the conference as I am able. With some luck I may be able to visit a few of the sites in New Orleans as well, and provide a bit of background about the city’s singular place in the cultural history of race and space.  Below, a completely unrelated photo of the gorgeous Beckham’s Book Shop in the French Quarter. They don’t make ‘em like this anymore.
