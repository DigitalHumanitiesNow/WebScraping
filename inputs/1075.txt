The SL History Wiki chronicles the history of the Second Life virtual world. The wiki includes an interesting mix of the culture of Second Life communities and characters (E.g. character records, holidays, sports), and a documentation of the changes in the technology that makes up Second Life (a timeline of software development, titled "Second Life Through the Ages").
