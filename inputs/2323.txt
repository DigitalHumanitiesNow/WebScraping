Asi Burak, president ofÂ Games for ChangeÂ reflected on the growth that the organization and theÂ movementhas experienced over the past decade. Emphasizing Action As an academic, so much of my time at conferences is spent eitherÂ presentingÂ to a largely passive audience or quietly consuming (or daydreaming) other peopleâs panels, lectures, and posters. Sure, the conference space can be enlivened through engaging activity andÂ digital dialogue, butconferencesÂ are places I spend a lot of professional energy that can occasionally feel unfulfilling. In contrast, Iâm enthused by how Games For Change is intentionally a festival. Games, creativity, ingenuity are aspects to celebrate. Challenging social justice topics globally through gaming is such a different stance for crowd participation and is one of the biggest appeals to me about being a Games for Change participant. Further, as Asi mentions in the video above, a focus on games and learning in U.S. schools will be of particular interest to DML (digital media and learning) attendees. Taking place in New York April 21-25, the Games for Change festival looks to be a destination to ignite inspiration for classroom practices and to network around games, learning, and social justice.
