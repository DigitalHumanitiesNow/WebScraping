Using as a case-study the fundamental ancient text, the Res         Gestae divi Augusti, this presentation argues in favour of a historical encoding of          inscriptions and primary sources in general. After a very light presentation of what          epigraphy is, it develops and defines what is the role of computer science for this kind          of archaeological material composed of text and nonverbal information, both are          historically essential to the study of Antiquity. One of the main activities is to represent          inscriptions and their historical information within the computer system in order to process          this information and to connect inscriptions that have got this historical information as a          common point. The techniques I explore to build this type of "m√©tasource" (J. Ph. Genet)          are XML encoding.
