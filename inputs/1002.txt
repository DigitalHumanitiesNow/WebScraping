Dan Cohen, Mills Kelly, and Tom Scheinfeldt have started Digital Campus, a podcast devoted to the pedagogical and scholarly aspects of digital humanities. Yet another example of why CHNM is such a fantastic place to work. The first podcast is entitled "Wikipedia: Friend or Foe?" Definitely good stuff, so subscribe to it!   *[CHNM]: Center for History and New Media
