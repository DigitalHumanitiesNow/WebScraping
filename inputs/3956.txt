Thought I’d post a bit of history: the IRC (Internet Relay Channel) log from the first THATCamp in 2008, presciently saved by Bess Sadler. We do still have a room called thatcamp on the IRC channel at irc.freenode.net, but Twitter has taken over much of the function that IRC then served. Do feel free to use the thatcamp IRC channel whenever you like!I’ve edited the log so that it can be more easily read, taking out all the lines about so-and-so leaving or joining the IRC. Enjoy.— Log opened Sat May 31 10:19:27 2008 10:19  just imagine if we were all piling on one collaborative spreadsheet 10:19  so can whoever controls thatcampbot consider the room-specific IRC channels? 10:19  ok 10:20  a wiki page for the schedule? 10:21  give me a sec to figure this out 10:21  is it possible to simultaneously irc chat, twitter, blog, and podcast? I’m going to try. — Log opened Sat May 31 10:26:08 2008 10:29  thatcamp450 for rdf discussion 10:30  about to start the text mining session 10:31  RDF…  am curious if anyone is working with AJAX or JavaScript browsing and navigation of OWL ontologies 10:34  text analysis software: www.lib.uchicago.edu/efts/ARTFL/philologic/ 10:35  philomine: philologic.uchicago.edu/philomine/ 10:37  in the text mining session in the lab (rm 462) 10:39  sean takats is explaining CHNM’s upcoming NEH-funded text-mining project 10:40  Sean’s not a “better” historian, he’s a “different” kind of historian 10:40  dancohen: hooray for funding  10:41  the techies are having an impromptu “keeping the wheels on” meeting — sustainability from a technical point of view 10:42  good thing we’re inside–just got a tornado watch alert from the fairfax messaging system, active until 10:30 tonight 10:42  yowza 10:42  RDF group talking about bibliographic data, citations, Zotero, data about museum/library objects 10:43  according sean: three aspects of text mining:  locating or finding documents,  automatically extracting data from documents (instead of manually reading), analysis of corpus 10:45  according to laura mandell: text mining can be used to identify terms of analysis not within your discipline 10:45  wow. really doesn’t LOOK like tornado weather (at least through my small window) 10:46  it feels like it, though 10:48  it’s great  to see everyone on IRC! 10:51  RDF: used to define relationships in restricted domains, perhaps more interesting. But movement in developing it is to make it applicable to broader and broader domains. 10:52  davelester: I set up thatcampbot to record the channel. I’ll give you the logs afterwards. 10:52  thanks bess_  10:56  can someone add thatcampbot to thatcamp450 10:56  asolove++ great idea.  can you do that bess_? 10:57  dan cohen: text mining tools need to useful for historians and may not be 10:58  text mining tasks: summarization, classification, extractions 10:59  asolove and davelester : I’ll give it a shot 10:59  asolove and davelester : I’ll get to  it on the break, I’m in the middle of a good conversation 10:59  np 11:03  ok thanks 11:06  I will be posting the URL’s we are talking about on del.icio.us with tag thatcamp 11:07  I’m going to start doing that for the RDF session as well 11:10  text mining does more than speed up historical thought; it should give us a new level of comprehension 11:11  FYI  – I updated the schedule, so that should be current based on the last change we tried to implement downstairs 11:11  thanks to everyone for patience and input 11:11  schedule at thatcamp.org/schedule/ 11:12  clioweb: thanks–you did a great job with the schedule; hard to optimize something that complicated 11:12  I think it worked out well 11:13  clioweb++ 11:14  people should feel free to use other rooms and spaces for ad hoc meetings 11:20  Karin, is there any chance you could let us use your wiki? 11:25  ben – sure, pass is karin 11:25  I’ll clean up later 11:29  www.dancohen.org/2006/08/08/mapping-what-americans-did-on-september-11/ 11:30  my best effort on text mining + geolocation 11:32  Karin, can you paste the URL? 11:35  Got it 11:35  could people post their session notes on the blog?  that’d be great 11:35  so far, been able to blog, tweet, and irc chat all at once; adding in the podcasting might be hard… 11:36  There was a GREAT discussion of technology and sustainability at EPA’s Science Forum last week – William McDonough, author of The Cradle to Cradle Revolution – www.amazon.com/Cradle-Remaking-Way-Make-Things/dp/0865475873/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1212248155&sr=8-1 11:37  dancohen: I’d love to see a live digital campus  11:37  me too – do it, Dan  11:37  actually, just set up a new wiki www.nirak.net/thatcamp/pmwiki.php?n=Main.HomePage 11:37  davelester: tom and I were thinking of doing it 11:37  Oh.

Something to read ont he plane ride home.  22:26  Are you leading any discussions tomorrow? 22:26  no, I don’t think so 22:26  I plan to be an “active participant” in the omeka one, though! 22:27  I can’t decide betwen that and interface design. So many tough choices. 22:27  oh damn, did they schedule those across from each other? 22:28  * bess_ runs off to check the schedule 22:29  Dammit, I want to attend every single one of the first sessions 22:30  I mean the second session 22:30  I know. :/ 22:30  I’m sure all the first sessions will be great, too, but mashup is the only one for me.  22:30  Hopefully people will blog their sessions/ 22:30  but GIS, interface design, omeka, and bibliographic standards… I’m working on every one of those right now.  22:31  I will go to management since it pertains most to my job.

See you tomorrow! 23:15  Having trouble deciding ‘Hacking Omeka’ vs ‘GIS/Maps’ vs ‘Interface Design’! — Day changed Sun Jun 01 2008 07:11  mornin’ 07:11  how do i see what everybody has twittered to @thatcamp all at once? 07:44  morning 09:14  asolove breaking free of xml! 10:09  text session has been interesting 10:10  mashup session is fascinating. 10:10  what was covered? 10:10  what was covered in text? 10:10  just using Yahoo/Google/Simile tools, or something additional? 10:11  mashups talked more about APIs, permanence and guidelines for APIs, and not so much about tools and implementations. 10:11  uh huh 10:11  we discussed some uses and issues with TEI, alternate storage formats 10:11  (importance of spending the time to develop APIs and make available) 10:12  and cool graphical interfaces for creating digital texts without knowing XML 10:12  what alternate storage formats 10:12  very interesting 10:13  asolove: we’re talking about everything from google maps, to library of congress web services, to the importance of permanent urls and the implications for scholarship 10:14  excellent conversation, I’m generating way more ideas than I’ll possibly be able to implement 10:14  sounds very interesting, sorry I had to present this round 10:15  asolove: I get the feeling there will be lots of blog posts and writeups about this one 10:15  Raymond closed with programmableweb,com 10:36  fyi.. I posted a summary of the Text Mining session from yesterday: www.spellboundblog.com/2008/06/01/thatcamp-2008-text-mining-and-the-persian-carpet-effect/ 10:41  INTERFACE DESIGN IN 401 10:41  whoops 10:43  asolove: what’s the discussion about in 401? 10:43  funny 10:43  I think we’re looking at the JGAAP interface 10:46  can’t believe I didn’t realize you can put a URL to a KML file like this in the search blank for Google Maps! 10:46  pleiades.stoa.org/places/archaic.kml 10:47  nowviskie: wow! I didn’t know you could do that either! 10:49  yeah, bess — guess what’s going to be on Joe’s to-do list when we get home!  10:49  Bibliograph session 10:50  I mean Bibliography 10:50  Zotero is a good tool for moving bibliographic information from one place to another 10:51  Bruce D’Arcus style language for bib (CSL) 10:51  bibliograph(y or ic)  10:52  re: mashing up georeferenced data — this also works in Google Maps: pleiades.stoa.org/places/archaic.atom 10:52  if the biblio group would like me to come over to 450, let me know 10:52  we have Trevor here! 10:53  ok, just checking 10:53  for future thatcamp – find software for all urls opened in all sessions to be automatically saved into one big links file (coins-enabled?) so people could later follow links from sessions they missed 10:55  zotero/content/tools/csleit.xul 10:59  nowviskie: maybe we could give David G. access to the google sat imagery that way… allow people to export a kml file of the layer he wants and open it in google maps / google earth 11:00  tjowens: note the second author at rfc.net/rfc1165.html 11:05  in the interface design session (rm 401) we’re debating how much to ask users what a good UI is for a tool or collection 11:07  re ui: unix tends to optimize for the most common use case, which is the experienced user — explains why man pages tend to be cryptic for those unfamiliar with a particular command 11:08  jgsmith: right. good point. 11:10  in the omeka hacking talk we’re making unreasonable demands of the omeka dev team 11:10   11:11  jgsmith: does unix optimize for the most common use case, or the simplest, decomposed, filterable use case? 11:11  it optimizes for the case of people who have write access to the man page in a project 11:11  asolove++ # so true! 11:12  well, most people using unix are experienced in unix — the inexperience period is short compared to the rest of a person’s career 11:12  nice parallel: in bibliography, we’re bordering on making unreasonable demands on the zotero team 11:12  matthewgaventa: I’m going to make my unreasonable demands during the lunchtime zotero session 11:13  doesn’t mean an interface should be poorly designed — but designed for the person familiar with the process or the concepts involved 11:13  the design might encourage users to learn the underlying system 11:14  asolove: -nod- — easier to do in a GUI than a CLI 11:15  note to people making unreasonable demands of CHNMers: don’t make us release the hounds on you. 11:18  unreasonable demands++ 11:19  fluidproject.org/ and Yahoo UI provide open source nice-looking widgets for websites 11:19  that are tested across many browsers 11:20  for reference: URL I demo-ed is labs.nypl.org/projects/maps/transparent.html 11:40  OAI/PMH plugin for omeka is fantastic.
