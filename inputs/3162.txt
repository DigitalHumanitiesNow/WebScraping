This semester has been rather busy for me with various projects at the John Jay Library, two computational linguistics courses at the Graduate Center, and an imminent performance with Gamelan Kusuma Laras. Phew! I’ve been lucky to have the chance to give a presentation a month this semester, and have added slides & notes on my Selected Presentations page and below.
