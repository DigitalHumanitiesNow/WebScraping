 The Public Archive recently interviewed Ada Ferrer about her latest book, Freedomâs Mirror: Cuba and Haiti in the Age of Revolution (2014): FERRER: “Among slaves and people of color you see something equivalent. Many scholars have argued that the Haitian Revolution âto quote Eugene Genoveseââpropelled a revolution in consciousnessâ among African Americans. I agree, but again it was one based on material contact and knowledge. So, I was surprised for instance to see that documents such as the Haitian Declaration of Independence and other important texts of black leaders were actually translated into Spanish, published in newspapers, and circulated in Cuba, where they were read and discussed by people of color. Black people had real access to the words, ideas, and pronouncements of the revolution. Again, it was not only some vague abstract hope that slaves and free people of color in Cuba had; they engaged with the revolution and later with the Haitian state in more concrete ways. There are many other examples I could give and that appear throughout the book.” Read the rest: Dark Specters and Black Kingdoms: An interview with historian Ada Ferrer.Filed under: Ada Ferrer Tagged: blogroll, caribbean, cuba, emancipation, haitian revolution, maroonage, resistance
