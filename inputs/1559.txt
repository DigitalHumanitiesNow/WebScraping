GSummit 2015 is Back! Nominate Your Favorite Speakers for GSummit 2015 At long last, GSummit 2015 is coming this Fall. If you have an awesome case study, design concept or product demo revolving aroundÂ gamification to present, this is the right event for you. We welcome speaker nominations either for yourself or someone you know to present at GSummit 2015. Talks at GSummit are 25 minutes of high-impact, data-rich affairs. The speaker should be comfortable in this format and be able to share your know-how with the community. In addition to the lecture format, GSummit will also host mini workshop sessions due to popular demand from last yearâs event. Workshops hosts will spend 120 minutes with their attendees imparting their in-depth knowledge on the chosen subject matter with hands on material. Please complete the submission form for the selection committee to review your proposal. Do note that approvals are done on a rolling basis. Upon selection, our committee members will get in touch to provide further instructions leading up to the event. Check out our top-rated talks from last yearâs conference to get a feel of our audienceâs expectations in quality. GSummit tickets are not out yet but they do sell out fast so make sure you register to get the latest event updates and future announcements.  --- Watch GSummit SF 2014 videos on-demand from our partner FORA.tv The post Nominate Speakers for GSummit 2015 appeared first on Gamification Co.
