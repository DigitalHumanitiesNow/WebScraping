tripleC  Special issue: Philosophers of the World Unite! Theorising Digital  Labour and Virtual Work – Definitions, Dimensions and Forms Edited by Marisol Sandoval, Christian Fuchs, Jernej A. Prodnik, Sebastian Sevignani, Thomas Allmer in context of the COST Action Dynamics of Virtual Work http://dynamicsofvirtualwork.com/  tripleC: Communication, Capitalism & Critique 12 (2): 464-801 (pdf and html)http://www.triple-c.at/index.php/tripleC/issue/view/29   This special issue of tripleC: Communication, Capitalism & Critique  aims to contribute to building a theoretical framework for the critical  analysis of digital labour, virtual work, and related concepts that can  initiate further debates, inform empirical studies, and inspire social  struggles connected to work and labour in and beyond digital capitalism.  The papers collected in this special issue (a) provide systematic  definitions of digital labour, (b) analyse its specific dimension, and  (c) discuss different forms of digital labour. The papers collected  in this special issue theorise digital labour as a multifaceted field  characterised by exploitation, alienation, precariousness, power,  inequality, ideology, and struggle. These problems of digital labour are  however not inherent to digital technology as such but result from its  inclusion and application in capitalist relations of production. Theorising digital labour, as labour that produces or makes use of  digital technologies, can help to understand its problems, limits,  potentials, and contradictions. It can therefore highlight the need for  social change and inspire political action. However, the act of freeing  digital technology from being an instrument for the domination of labour  requires to go beyond just interpreting the world and to engage in  social struggles that want to change it.    TOC: Introduction: Philosophers of the World Unite!
