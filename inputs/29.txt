- i don't know...how the internal demon of the apparatus operates. what rules it obeys. this secret with no mystery frequently marks our dependence in relation to many instruments of modern technology - jacques derrida -The last three months have probably been the busiest of my life, spending around 15 hours a week in the classroom or lecture hall alongside various other academic duties (including starting a new module in Digital and Cyberculture Studies which I'll post about soon). As such I haven't had the chance to post new research, though it has been going on, if a little slower than I'd like.Late last term the Exeter philosophy society very kindly invited me to talk to them about some aspect of my work and I took the opportunity to speak on some issues which readers of this blog will know I've been interested in for a long time, but also on some of the newer concerns which have been guiding my current work. I'm increasingly fascinated by objects, object oriented ontology, phenomenology, and how these things might be brought together to better understand the ways in which we interact with our world. I'd like to thank the philosophy society for the chance to test these ideas out, for their wonderful hospitality, and for their challenging questions afterwards. They offered generous patience in encouraging my presenting work in progress, and their suggestions and queries have shaped the direction that this research will go in.In this talk I tried to cover a lot of ground knowing that there would be discussion afterwards. I discuss how we might think of technologies, technological artefacts, as being the products of evolution, as embodying knowledge, and why it might be useful to do so. I go on to talk about how human knowledge of objects might be a constantly changing thing, and how repeatable practice can be a measure of both knowledge and essence. If you're interested in any of the issues raised here I'd love to hear from you in the comments or by email.Evolving Objects: Artefacts as Embodied Knowledge.My  work, since my MA, has been on the effects of reading on screen,  what happens when we start to use iPads and Kindles to read books,  and this is how I pretend that I'm still an English researcher  whilst I'm increasingly interested in the philosophy and  neuroscience of interacting with objects.We  often hear people saying that using new technologies is âunnatural,â  and in discussions of e-reading this is certainly the case - the  printed book is seen as somehow a ânaturalâ way of reading,  whereas an electronic e-reader is an unnatural contrivance,  something which gets in the way, something which separates us from  the physical experience of the world in the same way that a  mechanical digger separates us from the earth and the act of  digging, unlike getting in the hole and getting dirty with a spade  or with our hands.The  word for this seperation is âvisceral insulationâ and it  basically describes what we might refer to as culture - the  increasing distancing of ourselves from the messy realities of the  world.I  wasn't convinced that this is what technologies do, however, that  they do take us away from the world rather than, instead, simply  revealing different aspects of it.For  that matter I wasn't really sure what a technology actually was -  what makes the mobile phone in your pocket, a prehistoric axe, and  the large hadron collider of the same order of objects - what makes  us call all of these things technological?I  don't want to discuss that idea today, or maybe we can discuss it  later, but during my writing I've come to describe technologies as  things which expand not just our capacity to do, but also our  capacity to conceive of doing - that we should rightfully consider  as technological those things which change our perception of what we  can achieve in the world. A hammer not only allows us to drive nails  it allows us to conceive of doing so without special attention paid  to the issue. Technologies pick up some of our cognitive effort as  well as being energy and time saving; they change us.So  here is where I'd like to begin today: Is there some way of  describing the mechanism by which we get used to technology as it  gets used to us, a mechanism which doesn't paint it as visceral  insulation, as technology getting in the way of a messy reality, but  instead fully embeds technology in very human processes?To  this end I'd like to argue that technologies evolve. I'm  not saying that our artefacts could occur without our influence,  quite the opposite, but I do think that it makes sense to look at  their development as an evolutionary event and that it is productive  to do so, opening up new areas of thought to be put to work on these  objects. To examine this idea I'll detail a brief, basic, and  largely canonical theory of evolution which will provide us with  most of the terminology that will allow us to then use the language  of evolutionary epistemology to discuss technology as âembodied  knowledge.âI'd  also like to look at reframing a phenomenological term, eidos,  in order to describe our changing experience of technology, and I  hope to use it to deepen the evolutionary approach that I'll begin  with.Evolution,  fundamentally, is the meeting of an organism and an  environment in such a way that three things occur: variation,  selection, and reproduction. The organism can also be  called a phenotype, the particular expression of a set of genes  given to it by its parents - this set of genes is called the  genotype, and we can think of the sum total of all of the genotypes  for a particular species as constituting a gene pool. So a gene pool  is every gene available to an entire species, the genotype is all of  the genes that a particular animal carries in its body, and the  phenotype is the expression of those genes as an individual and  unique subject.In evolutionary  terms an animal is successful if it survives long enough to go on to  reproduce, to pass on its genes by producing young after resisting  the threats, and utilising the supports, of its environment. This  sets the stage for the three evolutionary effects.Variation comes from the passing on of genes not being perfect - sometimes a  phenotype expresses genes which are outside the normal boundaries of  a species.This variation then  joins an ongoing process of selection, the natural selection  which is perhaps the most famous aspect of evolution: the  environment exerts pressures on organisms, threatening their safety  and ability to reproduce. If an organism with a new  variation, a new genetic mutation, survives long enough to reproduce  then it will pass on its new genotype to its offspring and the gene  pool is changed, the species starts to shift.So how might this  be applicable to technology, and to human-made artefacts more  generally?Firstly we need to  define the individual (for the sake of clarity I'll abandon the term  organism), and let's choose a machete.The  modern machete is a ubiquitous tool in many tropical countries where  it's used to cut away vegetation when travelling through dense  jungle and to harvest tough crops such as sugar cane. It's  essentially a long knife, around a third to half a metre long, often  with a slightly curved blade that's typically set into a wooden or  plastic two part haft bolted together through a full tang. The  machete, for our discussion, is the individual,  the non-biological corollary to an organism.I've  chosen the machete as its most obvious feature is its long blade,  and in fact I want to reduce the machete to this one thing, a knife  with a new mutation of an extended blade. We can think of it  similarly to a hummingbird being reduced to its capacity for static  flight, or, to use an example that I'll want to return to, a stick  insect looking more or less like a stick.With  our individual defined we now need to consider its environment.With  non-artefact entities the environment is easily defined: everything in the milieu in which it exists which  can directly or indirectly impact upon its development or its  surviving long enough to reproduce. But for artefacts, and for  machetes specifically, that milieu is more specifically defined,  though the same principles apply: we are the defining selective forces for our artefacts; human users are  the environment for our material equipment.Just as an ice age  âchoosesâ whether a dinosaur gets to reproduce, so we choose the  fittest forms of artefacts to be repeated, the one's that fit their  environment, the ones that fit to us. That we can make this as a  conscious decision rather than dispassionately enacting selective  forces is irrelevant; the end result is that the environment does or  does not allow a new generation to emerge based on what has come  before.So if the  individual is a machete, and we are the environment, then we have at  least the arena for evolution to occur. Next the three phases of the  evolutionary process need to be established:Variation in  knife manufacture and design is clear: from the first stone blades  used by early hominids through to multi-component contemporary  cutting tools, the sheer variety of blade lengths and shapes, handle  styles, materials, components, etc. is staggering. Each new  development comes from a mutation derived from environmental effects  which alters the range of a feature to be expressed, i.e. humans  continually try new things. In a culture where knife blades are  typically between two and five inches, a 15 inch blade is a mutation  which, if used successfully, permanently alters the potential set of  blade lengths for future generations of knives.This  is down to selection - For evolution to occur, pressures from the environment must cause  a match or mismatch of fit for the individual. The  contemporary, relatively standardised machete comes from a process  of environmental selection - we choose whether a machete, or any  other knife, is successful enough to be recreated.When  it comes to reproduction,  the machete doesn't have genes, and it can't facilitate the creation  of the next generation of long bladed knives, but I think that the  third evolutionary criteria still stands. A machete's traits get  reproduced when an aspect of the environment causes them to be, i.e.  when a long bladed knife is used successfully an individual user is  more likely to recommend it to other potential users, and to produce  or request this trait themselves when they next need a tool.Is there a  relationship between âparentâ and âoffspringâ here? This  would require us to think of the knives which follow those currently  produced as being their offspring which doesn't seem quite right. Or  perhaps not.If we think of the  collected group of all machetes as a gene-pool, then it doesn't seem  too problematic to see any individual machete as the phenotypic  expression of a set of traits that comes directly out of that pool,  and the continuing success of that expression contributes to  maintaining the overall pool of possibilities as it is. The more we  want to use a particular thing the more those sorts of things will  stay the same.The  significant difference here between an organism and a machete seems  to be one of agency: the organism struggles against the environment  and tries to reproduce, whereas the machete is innately passive. But what  causes variation, selection, and reproduction is not the measure of whether  a process is evolutionary.In  the 60s Marshall McLuhan pre-empted this idea: he argued that we are âthe sex organs of the machine world, as the bee of the plant  world, enabling it to fecundate and to evolve ever new formsâ  (Understanding  Media 56).  Blade  length, we can argue, is a heritable trait in knives.This,  I hope, explains my initial interest in seeing artefacts as evolved  - there's a certain neatness which is appealing.But  an evolutionary model for artefacts also opens up a branch of  philosophy which might help us in our wider discussion of  technology: If artefacts abide by the basic structures of an  evolutionary process then we may be able to consider them in terms  of evolutionary epistemology.Epistemology  - the study of knowledge, acquiring knowledge, and knowing - is  blended in evolutionary epistemology with evolutionary theory to  describe two increasingly distinct fields: firstly, evolutionary  principles applied to the progression of knowledge, particularly in  the sciences and, secondly, the study of knowledge acquisition in  living beings, where cognition and knowing are seen as evolutionary  adaptations.I  won't discuss the first branch of evolving ideas, because I want to  focus on the physical, and the second branch of evolutionary  epistemology, where knowledge is seen as an adaptation, allows us to  consider knowledge as a physical thing.I'd  like to adopt the vision of evolutionary epistemology that Henry  Plotkin outlines in Darwin  Machines and the Nature of Knowledge,  as the elegance of his theory pairs well with the bare-bones  mechanism of evolution that we've encountered. I would like to argue  that Plotkin's approach allows us to talk about evolutionary  epistemology as it might apply to artefacts in their alternative  environment of human use.Plotkin's  central idea is that as organisms adapt to their environments via  evolutionary selective pressures; what successful individuals pass  on to their offspring in each generation is not just genetic  instructions for building new bodies, but knowledge about the world that came before them.His  most striking example is that of the stick insect: a stick insect  looks like a stick not because it tries or learns to, but because  generations of stick insect ancestors survived more frequently the  more that they looked like sticks and avoided becoming prey long  enough to reproduce and pass on genes which stipulated increasingly  stick-like bodies for the next generation. Plotkin argues that the  stick insect's body has a knowledge of an aspect of the world  far greater than its own mind is capable of.This  immediately raises the question âwhy use the word 'knowledge' to  describe an adaptation?â, and Plotkin asks the question himself:  âwhy take the further step of equating adaptations with  knowledge?...How can the wing markings of a moth[, for instance,] be  knowledge?â (Darwin  Machines 117).Plotkin  defends the word choice on the grounds of looking at what knowledge  means in âeveryday life,â saying that âknowledge, in its most  common meaning, denotes a mental state that bears a specific  relationship to some features of the worldâ (4).When  we say that we âknowâ something we're stating that there is  parity between two things: âa brain state, which is a part of  organismic organization, and the world itself...which is the feature  of environmental order relative to which that brain state standsâ  (117).Knowing  someone's name, or where our house is, or what a machete looks like,  requires that we incorporate that information into ourselves in some  way; we materially modify ourselves to reflect an aspect of external  reality however imperfectly. For Plotkin there must be a brain state  which represents the thing in the world:âknowledge  is always something that comes in two parts. There is the 'knower's  end' of knowledge, comprising feelings, brain states and...the means  of expressing the knowledge; and there is the 'world's end' of  knowledge, which is that aspect of the world that is known. All  knowledge is a relationship between the knower and the knownâ  (10-11).Now  this is not to say that there's a miniature version of the world  playing out within our brains, simply that for an act of knowing to  occur there must be a state of cognition or of memory which has a  physical instantiation and which maps to our experience of, recall  of, or interaction with an object or state in the world, and in that  sense we might be said to incorporate and represent it.By  envisioning knowledge in this fundamental stripped down fashion, as  a manifestation in response to a thing in the world, Plotkin is able  to use the word to describe adapted biological organisms' relation  to their environment.Evolutionary  adaptations, like everyday human knowledge, always have a  relational quality. Every adaptation comprises organization of an organism  relative to some feature of environmental orderâ¦The wing markings of a  moth stand in relation to the nervous system of a predator, specifically the  way in which that nervous system is wired such that the âeyeâ [of the  moth's markings] startles the predator and perhaps causes it to fleeâ¦All  human knowledge has the same two-component relationship that  adaptations have (116-117).Adaptations  conform the bodies of evolved organisms to the worlds that housed  their lineage; a stick insect's body is the sum total of the  knowledge gleaned from the environments of its ancestors.  In this way stick insects incorporate an aspect of the environment  into their being: simply, they are material instantiations of the  knowledge that the environments which preceded them favoured insects  which looked like sticks.The  question now becomes whether, if the development of artefacts can be  seen as an evolutionary process, can the theories of this branch of  evolutionary epistemology also be applied to them?To  my knowledge, no evolutionary theory of artefacts or technology has  explicitly drawn this conclusion, but it is something that I believe  Plotkin's vision of evolutionary epistemology and an  artefact-compatible theory of evolution can argue.Stick  insects' bodies match a world state which remained relatively  consistent over generations, thus their biological knowledge of that  aspect of the world grew. Fitness to the environment for artefacts  is the same as for organisms in as much as success depends on  matching a world state in such a way that the environment doesn't  obliterate the traits of a particular individual, a particular  expression of the possibilities available.In  a tropical climate the machete shape is the best fit for its  environment. This is not to say that the machete matches the jungle,  or incorporates an aspect of the jungle, like the stick insect and  the branches where it lives, it doesn't; the machete has no evolved  knowledge of the jungle as the jungle isn't its environment. But the  machete does have a knowledge of how part of its own environment  intersects with the jungle, how human users experience that  terrain.A  short stone knife is no use for swiftly clearing plant life, so when  metal came along which allowed for thin, strong blades which could  be carried easily it was adopted for that task. Metal also  introduced the possibility for a new variable of blade length. A  longer blade allowed for large slashing motions to be made -  inefficient for precision work, but perfectly suited to human  passage through tropical vegetation.This is what the machete matches: the repeated moments where knife users  met the jungle.  Stick  insects, similarly, don't really know anything about sticks,  they actually know about predators eyes in much the same way as  machetes know about human hands' strengths and weaknesses in  relation to jungle creepers.Blades  became longer and longer as users discarded shorter blades and  created, or requested the creation of increasingly machete-like  knives; similarly, blades that were too long or unwieldy quickly  disappeared as failed experiments, as failed mutations, as a lack of  knowledge.In  his discussion of evolutionary epistemology, Tommi Vehkavaara argues  thatThe ability to act successfully presupposes the knowledge how to act  successfully. Discursivelinguistically expressed justification is not always  necessary - if the ability to act is (successfully) demonstrated, no argument  can overcome this ultimate proof of knowledge. This kind of demonstrable  knowledge connects us to other forms of life - every living creature needs  at least some knowledge how to act successfully (in its environment). Of  course, knowledge does not determine the action it enables, it is just the  precondition for the action. Although an action can be seen as a  presentation of knowledge, the actual action is not necessary for the  existence of knowledge - knowledge is potential action, the power to do  (paper HERE, emphasis in original).A  stick insect is put into action in the act of being a stick insect;  a genotype  is knowledge in potential, a living phenotype is knowledge in  action. Every second that the stick insect is alive it demonstrates  that it has a knowledge of the consistent aspects of the  environments which led to its being: that there will likely be  oxygen to breathe, food to eat, sticks to look like, light to see  by, predators to evade, and other insects to mate with. The machete  differs in that it doesn't act second by second, it only acts during  use; but really the stick insect also only ever puts its biological  knowledge into action when it is in concert with its environment, it  just happens to never be outside of that environment. A stick insect  born into a vacuum doesn't act, it has nothing to know and simply  ceases.A  machete outside of use also doesn't act, it cannot demonstrate and  therefore cannot prove its knowledge until that concert with its  environment begins. But the moment that it is picked up it comes  into action, and the ensuing success of its use is a measure of the  accuracy of its knowledge.As  David Rothenberg notes â[n]o  machine stands apart from its creator, no tool makes sense outside  of its useâ (xv). This  fact allows us to use the notion of an evolutionary epistemology of  artefacts to better define the term artefact: anything that  potentially manifests a fit with an environment, but that cannot  perform the extent of its evolved knowledge without the impetus of  another agent. Artefacts exist as potential knowledge until they are  in use; they have, in Vehkavaara's terms, âthe power to do.âKnowledge  is the term that I want to use for the total information that a  thing has about the environment that it acts in.We  now need a term for individuals which possess information about  particular objects. I propose the term âunderstandingâ to  describe this special case of knowledge; it too is an objective  claim predicated on the potential for successful action. For  instance, we, as individuals, have an understanding of a particular machete when we are able to interact with it successfully.But  this is too simple, as is the assumption of evolved knowledge during  successful action in the world. When we know, or when we understand  something, when we breathe because our ancestors breathed, or when  we pick up a machete and use it effectively, what is it that we  access? We can never know everything about our environments, but  only code limited information about it in our memory or, over time,  in our bodies. In the same way we can never understand everything  about an individual object, we only ever have a limited access to  things. This is not a simple claim.When  I said that the stick insect knows her environment she of course  doesn't; there are always elements of even those specific things  she's meant to know that escape her. Her body does not access every  aspect of what it means to look like a stick in her world, in fact  it only relates to a tiny facet of the environment whilst the rest  recedes from that knowledge; even her bodily knowledge of sticks and  predators is vanishingly discrete.It's  maybe clearer to look at this idea in terms of understanding: When I  interact with a machete as an object in my environment I feel that I  can start to have an understanding of it, of what makes it what it  is, but is this the case? For Kant I cannot ever know the thing  itself, or rather cannot know if I know, cannot know if my  representation matches the reality, but for Edmund Husserl, the  father of modern phenomenology, I can start to move toward the  thing, if only via accessing its representations; for Husserl I can  access what the thing performs in concert with my perceiving it, and  this draws me closer to things themselves.The  idea that things might retreat away from our intentions is important  to understanding how we interact with artefacts and the discussion  has been revivified by the new philosophical field of Object  Oriented Ontology, in particular Graham Harman's approach in  arguably Object Oriented Ontology's founding work, Tool-Being.The  argument of Tool-Being is that no object is ever encounterable as what it is, and, against  Husserl, that the phenomena we do encounter are never simply derived  from things as they really are. Harman  is interested in the non-relational aspects of things, the essences  which recede from and precede all relations with anything in the  world.Harman  gives the example of viewing a bridge:If I stare at a bridge, this bridge-appearance is a parasite off of my Dasein [roughly:   my being], and could hardly be less independent. If not for me, this appearance could   not exist. What is truly independent of me is not the occurentbridge, but the    executantbridge, the bridge that is hard at work in enacting its own reality and all   that this entails (emphasis in original, 125).For  Harman, the occurrent bridge, the bridge as it is seen, is not born  of the essential bridge alone, and therefore provides no access to  it; the essential executant bridge acts independent of and  inaccessible to me.What  Harman's notion of tool-being, of a subterranean life for all  objects, fundamentally asserts is that "[w]hen I encounter an object, I reduce its being to a small set of features out of all   its grand, dark abundance...[M]y encounter with the object is relational, and does not   touch what is independently substantialin the things" (125-126).At  all times, however, we have complete access to things as they are to us,  or, more correctly, as they are with us. This  totality of subjective information I would like to term âeidos,â  a term drawn from Husserl meaning something's essence, but a term  which Harman's Object Oriented Ontology, with its abolition of  discoverable essences, causes me to want to rewrite, as Husserl  appropriated the term from Plato who had used it to describe the  transcendental forms.Husserl  used eidos to describe the fewest number of aspects of something which identify  it as what it is, in  short, the essence of a thing. For  Husserl phenomenology  is an âeidetic science,â a seeking of what makes things what  they are.Eidos as essence is an important part of Husserl's ontology, and I don't  pretend to do it justice here, merely to argue that Husserl's usage  is tied to what makes a thing what it is.I,  instead, want to use the term eidos to describe what makes something what  it is for  us.  I suggest the emendation as I don't share Husserl's faith in our  ability to reach objects as they are.From  here on, when I talk about knowledge or understanding I will be  referring to the partial access we have achieved to things as they  are, to their essence, where something in our cognition, memory, or  bodies matches something in the world, a match that is demonstrable  only by the repeatable successful action described by Vehkavaara.For  every successful action that we perform we demonstrate that our  eidos of the intended thing has come at least partially in line with some  aspect of the thing's essence. I'll return to this point again.So  what is eidos,  as I'm  conceiving of it, comprised of? At its simplest it would be those  aspects of an an encountered object that we would describe to  someone if we were aiming to convey its nature, for instance that a  glass is relatively heavy, fragile, transparent, and frequently used  to hold liquids. This has appealing links back to Husserl and the  eidetic reduction of an item, through the stripping out of anything  that isn't essential, to its fundamental components in order to  better understand it.I  would like eidos to refer here to any aspect of a thing which gives it a boundary in  our mind, which seems to mark it out from its environment as being  what it is. This would include, but isn't limited to:Observations   (visceral sensory experience, visual, tactile, etc.)Aesthetics   (how it sits, intellectually, in visible, audible, olfactory,   tactile, or gustatory relation to other things)Historical   information (what caused it to be produced including, but not   restricted to evolutionary processes)Scientific   understanding (knowledge of its physical reality, chemistry,   biology etc.)Classification   (how we would describe it to others, how we would compare it to   other things)Collective   information (information regarding the item (or how it is   positioned) culturally as passed on by other individuals)Action   potential (what we expect to be able to achieve with, or to be   denied by the thing)As  I've described it, eidos is not, unlike knowledge or understanding, an objective claim. When  an action is repeatably successful then we know that it must be  based on accurate knowledge or understanding of at least some  relevant aspect of the world. But eidos is only what we feel is understood, or known, and we can thus seem to know or understand  things which are false or incomplete.We  can talk then of a âweakâ or âstrongâ eidos: This is not an either or, but a continuum from a first basic  encounter to a complete apprehension of the thing itself, its  essence.The  weakest eidos is to simply see an object, and maybe to contemplate it in some  fashion. In many ways the idea of strengthening eidos is more intuitive then many of the issues that we've already  addressed: look harder at something and you'll begin to understand  it better, though this intuitiveness, at least in part, must come  from the terminology temporarily matching more common use.We  can grow our eidos of a thing by approaching an object and beginning to fill it up, to  develop a growing and changing understanding of the thing.But  Eidos can simply be complicated as well as strengthened. To complicate  eidos is simply to expand the gestalt that makes the thing what it is to  us, to include more aspects in our consideration. Scientific  investigation is the ultimate complexifier, moving our perception  beyond the levels at which we ordinarily operate.But  complexity doesn't automatically draw us closer to the things  themselves. In fact we can get toward things even with relatively  little complexity. How  many cat owners, for instance, understand the biology of their  particular pet? And yet their understanding of the creature seems so  strong. This is based on the success of their interactions with  them; their eidos of the cat is strong because what the cat is for them matches some  aspects of what the cat is in itself, it's essence, enough to  provide a successful interaction far more frequently than the animal  biologist, a stranger to the particular cat, who encounters it with  a complex, multi-faceted eidos already in place.The  owner understands the aspects of the cat that relate to their  interactions with it well enough; their eidos of the cat may be stronger than that of the more complex  understanding of the scientist. That cats can still surprise their  owners, and frequently do (!), shows, however, that the  understanding is far from complete.In  a BBC interview from 1962 Vladamir Nabakov spoke about apprehending  objects in a way which resonates with the notion of eidos that I'm attempting to construct here:Reality is a very subjective affair. I can only define it as a kind of gradual accumulation of information: and as specialization. If we take a lily, for instance, or any other kind of natural object, a lily is more real to a naturalist than it is to an ordinary person. But it is still more real to a botanist. And yet another stage of reality is reached with that botanist who is a specialist in lilies. You can get nearer and nearer, so to speak, to reality: but you never get near enough because reality is an infinite succession of steps, levels of perception, false bottoms, and hence unquenachable, unattainable. You can know more and more about one thing but you can never know everything about one thing; it's hopeless. So we live surrounded by more or less ghostly objects (qtd in Tim Dee, âNature Writing,â Archipelago 5 (2011), 27-28).This  accumulation of information, of specialising, is absolutely what I  would like to see as the attempt to fulfil eidos,  and Nabakov captures perfectly the impossibility of the task. We are left, always, with more or less empty ghosts, and as such  everything that we have an understanding of, no matter how close we  think that we may have gotten to it âas it isâ will always have  the capacity to surprise us when our actions, based on our  understanding not of the thing itself, but of an eidos we have constructed, are unsuccessful due to the effects of some  unperceived or incomplete aspect.As  such, when I say that repeatable successful action implies some  access to an aspect of a thing it really is in the weakest sense  possible: that the object allows this kind of interaction, and even  this only holds up to the point that it doesn't and we're surprised.A  strong eidos,  therefore, as I intend it here, is a conception where what makes  something what-it-is-to-us matches, at action facilitating points,  aspects of the thing intended. If  something changes too quickly, or if we never act with it on  multiple occasions, we can never tell whether we have accessed any  aspect of the thing in itself. But success is telling.How  do we measure the success of action? I have suggested that  successful action is repeatable action, not a particular goal  achieved with a particular tool, but any activity which can be  achieved over and over again with few surprises. We might not know  the chemical composition of graphite and wood, might not know the  geometrical angles of hexagonal cylindrical forms, might not have  training in draftsmanship, i.e. our eidetic experience of a pencil might not be complex, but believing that  every time we put that pencil to paper we can make marks within our  skill level as artists, a reality which manifests itself far more  often than it does not, shows that we have a good understanding of  some aspect of the essence of a pencil, and that our eidos of the pencil, if not complex, is (relatively) strong.For  me, this notion of eidos  goes  some way to explaining why the  bound book form feels more natural or more ârightâ: because it  acts predictably in line with the majority of objects in the world,  always âon,â not reliant on battery life, robust, and simple  enough for nearly all users to intuit the appropriate interaction  with it as an artefact to be brought to life. We might even define  modern technologies as those which deny intuitive understanding of  what makes them go; we are often surprised by our new tools because  we don't understand why they function.As  Jacques Derrida notes:With pens and typewriters, you think you know howit works, how it âresponds.â Whereas with computers, even if people know how to use them up to a point, they rarely know, intuitively and without thinking - at any rate, Idon't know - howthe internal demon of the apparatus operates. What rules it obeys. This secret with no mystery frequently marks our dependence in relation to many instruments of modern technology (PaperMachine 23).That  beautiful phrase, the secret with no mystery, describes Harman's  subterranean realm of tool-being, of unknowable essence, as well as  it describes the aspects of a technology which are most often  unavailable to us. When we consider physical books as being more  ânaturalâ it's not that they're not technological, but that  their encountered equipmental reality makes an intuitive sense; the  act of reading on a digital reading device, however, is built around  a set of unintelligible processes: The average user will perceive  the Kindle as a simple device, and their eidos of it might never need to be much more complex than that of the  printed book. But the Kindle has the greater capacity to surprise  the average user: we have no default, or drive, to know what makes  it tick.âReading  on screen doesn't feel rightâ a reluctant reader says. âThat  doesn't matter,â a happy screen reader replies, âyou'll get used  to it.â What does this mean, to get used to something which  started off feeling wrong?As  more aspects appear to the reader, as eidos is deepened, then this is an increase in a special kind of  knowledge: the reader better understands the equipment. Greater  understanding, as with all knowledge, increases the potential for  successful action, in this case reading will cease to ânot feel  rightâ and instead will stop feeling like anything at all.  Readers, even bibliophiles, rarely get interrupted in the activity  of reading by just how right it feels; interruption is the preserve of malfunctioning, of  surprise.But  it is also not enough to simply say that the reader will get used to  an artefact as they reveal it further, because reading is a meeting  of two evolved bodies, the reader and the equipment. Whilst the reader  might increase their understanding, this means nothing if the  equipment has no understanding of them. Each reader is part of the  environment in which each item of reading equipment sits, they are  an aspect of the environment to be known, a little bit of selective  pressure on the gene pool, like a successful predator being a part  of the environment that affects all stick insects, but also, in that  moment, a specific individual.And,  just as with the individual stick insect meeting the individual  predator, any individual (such as an e-reader) meeting an aspect of  its environment (such as a resistant reader) can pass on the  information it gains from that meeting to the next generation of its  species.For  every successful event, that stick insect knows it lives in a world  where it's particular bodily knowledge allows it to succeed, its  continued successful action demonstrates this knowledge. In the same  way, every time a resistant reader puts down a Kindle and says âno,  this just isn't for me,â and never buys one, and never recommends  one, and maybe even actively tries to discourage other potential  readers from getting one, a similar knowledge gain occurs: that Kindle didn't exist in a world where it could act successfully with  that  reader,  with that aspect of its environment.This  affects its whole species, even if in a minute way, and minute  effects played out over and over again is what evolution rests upon.  Thanks to the peculiarities of their environment, artefacts tend to  experience a much more focussed set of selective pressures on each  generation. Artefact evolution can therefore be swift, at least  until its knowledge of the environment is such that most of its  encounters are successful; the printed book, for instance, has  reached a relative equilibrium, but the artefacts of electronic  reading are under pressure and fluctuate.Some people don't  like the feel of reading books on portable screens.I  hope that I have shown that when artefacts gain a knowledge of us,  and we gain an understanding of them - fleshing out an eidos - then we affect one another. The environment which must be known  alters itself, the individual which must know is changed, and the  adoption of equipment must represent, in some ways, a conforming to  one another.The exact nature of  every conformation is impossible to comprehend, each is tied to the  vastness of environmental influences and to the millions of  individual users meeting millions of individual artefacts and  reporting back, in various ways, to the pool which results in the  next generation. But that such gains occur is written in the body of  every object and in the mind of every user; in every repetition of a  successful interaction there is the demonstration that knowledge of  one kind or another has been gained.Physical  books allow us to play with paper and bring it to life, half turning  pages so that they pass by quicker, drumming fingers, running a nail  under an important line, dog-earing corners, doodling and  note-taking, mourning and then relishing the bangs and bumps and  creases as they accumulate; users will always develop their own  routines of interaction.I  think that some resistant readers doubt  that people will find a way to place importance onto their digital  things in the same way that they have with print, but that's what  being human is all about, making things not just things is what  we do.  Every stickered laptop, every passed-on memory stick, every  annotated electronic text, every emoticon-ed instant message, every  abbreviated SMS, every nail-varnished mobile, every cheap home  movie, every bedroom recording, every tagged photo, every lovingly  tended Myspace, Deviant Art, and Live Journal profile is testament  to the fact that we spend our days making things our's, as in mine,  and ours', as in for all of us.These  are gains of understanding, of moving away from just a method for  getting something done to being changed by things. How long could it  be until e-books are regularly more than words on a bundle of  screens? How long can it be until people, once again, use these  things until they are beautiful?We  are slowly building the history for digital reading that on a long  enough timescale will imbue screens with the same richness as paper  pages. They traverse the same path as the machete: we find or make  the objects, or cause them to be made; we use them; we select what  makes them work, or what does not; and they get made again and  again; and we make them sing.It  is unsurprising that the printed book which has evolved over  hundreds of years should have naturally worked its way toward  fitting our bodies exactly; the book has been tailored, adapted by  the repeated use of generations. And the haptics of the printed form  do make sense: it fits the hand; the pages are thin for the most  amount of storage in a compact and cheap space; it is more portable  than a carving, and more adaptable than a scroll; less complicated  than an iPad; less fragile than a Kindle.E-readers  possess a different, and currently lesser evolved understanding of  their users than a printed book does. But no environment for  knowledge is static, evolution always occurs, and when it comes to  our artefacts we would do best not to attempt to halt, but instead  to guide it. E-readers, or something like them, can become mundane  before becoming essential, and this is the path that every artefact  we value or even love has gone through.
