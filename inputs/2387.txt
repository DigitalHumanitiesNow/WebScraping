Digital humanist Melissa Terras writes that âacademics need to work on their digital presence to aid in the dissemination of their research, to both their subject peers and the wider community.â Likewise, Christopher Long writes that scholars âwho do not intentionally cultivate an online scholarly presence will increasingly be at a disadvantage both professionally and academically.â In this presentation, Kris Shaffer will share what recent web analytics reveal about the impact that online activity can have on a scholarâs impact and visibility, making the case for more regular public engagement in academic work, especially from graduate students and early-career scholars. A mini-workshop will follow, demonstrating how scholars can take advantage of specific tools to engage wider audiences, including blogs, popular press, social media, and curating a âdomain of oneâs own.â</p>  <p>Bio</p>  <p>Kris Shaffer is Instructor of Music Theory at the University of ColoradoâBoulder and Editor for Hybrid Pedagogyâs long form publishing division.
