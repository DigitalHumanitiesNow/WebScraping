 Not quite, Spike -- I just wrote an Internet Film School column about the Thanksgiving episode ofÂ Buffy The Vampire SlayerÂ for the AV Club. Sample:  Thanksgiving is a holiday that allows filmmakers to get back to the mediumâs theatrical roots. No elaborate sets are required â just a table and some people who know each other so well they decided to come together once a year rather than interact regularly. It is a chance for film to scale back its visual ambitions and look like a play without stumbling into the stodgy stage direction of an old episode ofÂ Masterpiece Theatre.Â Only unlike those film adaptations of dramatic works, there is a natural quality to the limitations placed upon a film that happens on Thanksgiving. Everyone looks like theyâre in the same place not because the theater couldnât afford better sets, but because everyone is trapped in the same confined spaces by strained familial bonds. Because if ever there were a time and a place for families to fall apart, itâs Thanksgiving. Families fall apart all the time â I consider âfamilies falling apartâ to be a genre, and Noah Baumbach the current king of it â but never as spectacularly as they do during Thanksgiving. Perhaps as alluded to above, it is because of the artificially pressurized atmosphere the holiday creates. People who donât particularly like each other are yet again forced to make extended displays of false joviality in order to please the one family member who actually cares about everyone. Sometimes that character is a doting mother, sometimes a dying father, or in the case of the âPangsâ episode ofÂ Buffy: The Vampire Slayer, an empty-nested Chosen One whose surrogate family is on the brink of collapse...
