British History Online can now announce an important new addition to our Premium Content section: the Parliament Rolls of Medieval England. This source consists of scholarly descriptions of every parliament held in England between 1275 (when a parliament in something approaching its modern sense first met) and 1504. It  covers 10 monarchs, from Edward I to Henry VII (there was no parliament in the reign of Edward V, so he is not included). The rolls for some of these parliaments, particularly the earlier ones, do not always survive, but where they do these have been fully transcribed from the manuscripts; supplementary material about the business of the parliament is given in an appendix. Opposite the original text, which may be in Latin, Anglo-Norman, or Middle English, is a modern English translation. To make PROME easier to use, we have put the text and translation in tables, so that the corresponding paragraphs are simple to locate. Please note that this new content is available to current subscribers at no extra cost. If youâ€™re interested in subscribing you will find details here. For institutions trial subscriptions are also available.
