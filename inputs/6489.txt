Digital Humanities Hackathon on Text Re-UseâDonât leave your data problems at home!â 27-31 July, 2015 Hosted by the GÃ¶ttingen Centre for Digital Humanities (GCDH), Georg-August-UniversitÃ¤t GÃ¶ttingen, Germany Organised by: Emily Franzini, Greta Franzini and Maria Moritz The GÃ¶ttingen Centre for Digital Humanities will host a Hackathon targeted at students and researchers with a humanities background who wish to improve their computer skills by working with their own data-set. Rather than teaching everything there is to know about algorithms, the Hackathon will assist participants with their specific data-related problem, so that they can take away the knowledge needed to tackle the issue(s) at hand. The focus of this Hackathon is automatic text re-use detection and aims at engaging participants in intensive collaboration. Participants will be introduced to technologies representing the state of the art in the field and shown the potential of text re-use detection. Participants will also be able to equip themselves with the necessary knowledge to make sense of the output generated by algorithms detecting text re-use, and will gain an understanding of which algorithms best fit certain types of textual data. Finally, participants will be introduced to some text re-use visualisations. For more information about the Hackathon,Â please visit:Â http://etrap.gcdh.de/?p=669
