 One of my students shared a tip and I thought it was inspired! This particular student takes advantage of university resources, like the writing center. Â If you have an in-person appointment at our writing center the consultants will ask you to read your paper aloud and the consultant will make suggestions. Â I’m familiar with this method because this was the same pedagogy employed by my writing center at SCSU. Â Well, the student was working on their rough draft for a paper and wanted someone else to read it but didn’t have someone to just sit with him as he typed. Â So, how to solve this problem? The student cut and pasted sections of his paper into Google Translate and let the program read his writing back to him! Â I thought this was such a clever trick and is something that ELL and non-ELL students could implement. Â Its simple, easy to use, and easy to replicate. I love it when students share their brilliant ideas!
