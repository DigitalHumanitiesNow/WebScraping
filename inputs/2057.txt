The talk will describe the general architecture of a digital research environment         for manuscript and textual studies (particularly those pertaining to ancient Greek and Byzantine texts), and         discuss some questions of data representation and encoding in the framework of such an online research         platform (Teuchos. Zentrum f√ºr Handschriften- und Textforschung).
