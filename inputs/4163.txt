While attending Museums and the Web 2011, a while back, I heard someone blurt out, âmuseum games suck,â to the room. Never very fast on my (mental) feet, Iâve been ruminating on this statement for the past several months and have finally come to the conclusion that the pronouncement isnât quite accurate or fair. While I agree that many museum games arenât very good, are simplistic and unattractive; I donât believe this state of affairs unique to museum games. Indeed, the accusation could be leveled at educational games in general. In the case of museum games, there are a number of factors that align to create this backwater of interactive design development: lack of funds, lack of serious research agendas and, of course, the pesky requirement that you actually have to teach something through the game play. Add to this that most curators want you to incorporate REAL objects into the game and you have a nearly impossible situation.There are a few in this field who are looking for answers but I have to report that the conclusions drawn so far appear to place the blame on the use of narrative. The museum games gang seemed to have jumped into the ludology v. narratology fray and concluded that museum games would be better off without a narrative. Can this be true? To the rescue comes the first book on my summer reading list, Ian Bogostâs Unit Operations. I have to say that I am finding the book interesting reading and think Bogost may have put his finger on some conceptual issues that could be used to further museum game development. First, he defines the two extremes of this argument: extreme ludology would â seek to divest games of any engagement whatsoever with human experience; they would become mere abstract rule systems,â on the other hand, extreme narratology would âsee games only as producers of narrative, no matter what kind of configurative, unit-operational structures might underlie such production.â (p. 70, Bogost, 2008) Bogost then considers whether a rephrasing of the debate would illuminate the real issue, that is, perhaps we should ask if games need to produce stories while acknowledging that they might be able to do so.I can think of a number of commercial games that have only the most tenuous connection to a narrative such as Bejeweled or Solitaire and, if youâre trying to sell a game and donât care what the players learn, then addictive, meaningless, repetitive games are fine. (Lest you think I am too good for these things, Iâd like to confess that I have  spent many an hour playing Bejeweled and Solitaire.) However, I think we need to take this rephrasing a little further for our purposes and ask, do museum games need stories? One can imagine a science museum perhaps creating a game without much in the way of narrative to teach physics problems or chemistry. But, I have to ask, why would they want to? Itâs true that "pure" game play is capable of engaging players for long periods of time. But it is also true that narratives are an incredibly powerful mechanism for transmitting information both factual and emotional. Museum games need to convey meaning in both the affective and cognitive domains - would this be even possible without a narrative? It seems to me that itâs far too early in the game to give up on game narratives for educational museum games. Instead, our research should be focused on developing museum games that help express the game narrative, which incorporates the much of the educational content, through game mechanics. In short, we need to find a way to fully utilize this new medium to express the broad themes of the humanities.Before I move on Iâd like to define exactly what I mean by narrative for the sake of clarity. Narratologists, please excuse me as this is my laymanâs working understanding of the terms. First, I think of a story as something that has happened in the real world and define the narrative as the way in which that story is expressed. The written fictional story may be told in a classic plot structure which takes the reader through an emotional range; a film might use the same plot structure but express it through its own vocabulary and formal composition. However, non-fictional works such as an essay might be thesis driven and so be structured around the defense and argument of an idea to persuade the reader. So, what is a game narrative? Well, it should nothave the structure of a text-based plot driven narrative, for example,  as it is interactive, with player choice having some impact on the way the game plays out. Perhaps it is useful to think of game narratives as being made up of underlying thematic units that are (ideally) communicated through game mechanics. Note: I think that Bogost would argue, from what I have read so far, that written texts and art may also be understood as being made up of discreet unit interactions.Iâd also like to try to define the museum game experience a little. What exactly would we like a history/art history museum game to deliver? Objects, within the museum context, deal with material culture. That is, objects produced by a particular culture defined by geolocational and temporal variables. That object was interpreted and had meaning to the culture that made it. The same object is interpreted and has meaning, likely a different meaning, to those that view it within our contemporary culture. The object has been displaced from its original context and museum goers may have no understanding of the object at all. They will instead try to assimilate it within their own existing knowledge network based on the objectâs aesthetic qualities and the information they may happen to read from a wall label. The purpose of the museum exhibition is to make meaning by bringing a collection of objects together and linking them through a narrative told through text on labels, short videos and catalogs. Exhibits hope to create context, bring new understanding to light and interest viewers through different configurations that juxtaposes objects in ways that will form new linkages and meaning. I think we have been trying to recreate the traditional exhibition experience into a game format, which doesnât work so well in game, or in a museum, for that matter. One of the main issues is that we have been traditionally focusing on the stuff in the museums, when we really should be focusing on the people who made and used the stuff. Or, history games seem stuck on some particular recounting of the facts of history, instead of focusing on the things in history that are really interesting, like, for example, how did those people live and think? What did it mean to live then, during those times, and what do I think about that and why?The thing that has always intrigued me about video/computer games is the fact that they have the ability to merge story and games. I have to admit to always being disappointed as a kid with board games. The artwork and idea would seem to promise so much more than the game mechanics ever delivered, via cardboard. From Life to Monopoly, each referenced a story that really wasnât delivered by the game play. These games, for me, had more to do with the social interaction between other players than the game itself. Video games, on the other hand, can deliver that elusive world only hinted at by board games. Such a powerful tool demands a rethinking of our expectations, however. We need to begin to think differently about the problem in order to develop ways of using this new medium to fully express history and art.The first thing to do of course is to realize that itâs crazy to simply superimpose a linear plot structure onto a game. Although, having said that, Iâd like to point out that Jewel Quest : The Sleepless Star  appears to do just that and it is commercially successful and, honestly, the narrative coupled with games that mimic the action occurring within the plot, does add something to the experience. Mystery/adventure and RPGs appear to have the most promising narrative game structure with which to incorporate museum educational goals. I plan on conducting a thorough study of these genres later this summer as well as a critique of museum and educational games. I believe that computer driven games and interactive media can create experiences with which we can begin to engage players with the past and other cultures and, well, to think about them.
