The first of two volumes of The History and Antiquities of the County of Suffolk are now live on British History Online. Written by the Reverend Alfred Suckling of Barsham, the series was originally projected to cover the whole county. In fact, it was left incomplete after volume 2 appeared in 1848; one of three such partial multi-volume parish histories of the county. [For more detail, see Currie and Lewis (eds), English County Histories. A Guide (Stroud, 1994).]
