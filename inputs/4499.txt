I started the blog many years ago as a research and thinking space, and though I’ve used it very little publicly over the past few years, a great deal of the early writing and interaction here eventually made it in some form into my recently finished dissertation, “Game Fiction” (more about which soon). I’m sure the look of the place will change here and there, and I’m not promising frequent updates, but I do suspect Misc will see a bit more activity than, say, during the past 2 years. Note: those interested in the earlier MoveableType version of this blog may find the archive here: Â http://misc.wordherders.net/mt/
