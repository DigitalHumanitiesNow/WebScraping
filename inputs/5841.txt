I totally broke the rules too.  Most people just list the first five websites they go to every day, or go back through their browser histories.  I wrote an essay, I listed more than 5 websites, and theyâ€™re not exactly the first five I hit in sequence (Create Digital Music is usually read at night). Thanks to Tamsyn Gilbert for the invite!
