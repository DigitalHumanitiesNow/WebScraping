BREAKFAST [held by] CIE TRANSATLANTIQUE [at] SS LA CHAMPAGNE (SS;), Digital ID 475407, New York Public LibraryIt's hard to believe, but a year ago this week the New York Public Library launched What's on the Menu?! Two days in from our very first Tweet, we had 1,000 dishes transcribed. As of this writing, we have 866,636 dishes dishes transcribed and we're not done yet.  We still have many more menus to digitize and we're working hard on new ways to make the site even easier to navigate and use. But before the next year begins, Michael Inman, Ben Vershbow, and I wanted to take the time to say a sincere, bow-down, "you rock" thank you to those who have put in time to make this project a success, starting with all of you. Kitchen of restaurant, Digital ID 107735, New York Public LibraryWhen we launched WOTM? last April, we had no idea what the response of the project would be. Apparently, you like it. And we're beyond thankful to all of you who have spent time transcribing menus, writing in with suggestions, questions, and helpful comments. We wouldn't be here without your help. But like a real restaurant, there are many cooks in the WOTM? kitchen who have done so much to help move this project forward. We'd like to thank: Michael Lascarides and Kris Kelly for building the site as a labor of love. The National Endowment for the Humanities for their financial and intellectual support. To the American Historical Association for giving us the honor of the Roy Rosenzweig Prize. To the Institute of Museum and Library Services for their Sparks! support. Our interns: Edith Bellinghausen, Jayme Hall, Leslie Harker, and especially Amanda Glassman who kept the engine running and Twitter tweeting â even while low on gas. Rebecca Austin, Kate Summers, and Lucy Daniel Anderson for re-cataloging the physical menus to include the proper metadata. Pat Rader and Abigail Meisterman in our metadata team for helping us in those choppy waters. Eric Shows, Terrance D'Ambrosio, and the entire Digital Imaging Unit for scanning the menus and pushing them live. Rebecca Holte and Caryn Gedell in the Registrars Office for moving the menus safely. NYPL Labs: Dave Riordan, Mauricio Giraldo, and Zeeshan Lakhani for their skills and good humor. And finally, to Ann Thornton and the New York Public Library staff for their continued support and encouragement. The next course on this tasting menu will be arriving shortly.
