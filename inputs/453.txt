Oh my, what an interesting week for augmented reality, especially in the business front:Nokia Beta Labs revealed Live View, a revolutionary mobile augmented reality application. Well, unless you consider Wikitude, Layar, Junaio and many other "AR browsers" that came out in the last three years. Nokia was once a leader in AR research, it's a sad day to see them show off a product like that.Vuzix and German research institute Fraunhofer announced strategic alliance for development of display technology. Vuzix's CEO is optimistic (as am I) - "We have already seen results that we feel will provide a paradigm shift in the style, performance and cost of wearable displays".Microsoft licenses GeoVector's tech. Slashgear says the goal of this move is to challenge Google Goggles. Patent war against Google (like the current one against Android) can be another reason.PrimeSense's (Kinect) competitor, Omek raises $7 million from Intel Capital.Someone (well, Beck's) augmented the Statue of Liberty.Is the hype around AR disappeared altogether? That's at least what this article, named "What happened to augmented reality?" claims.This week's video features a cool street art by SWEZA named QRadio. Graffiti boom-boxes around Berlin start to play music when the QR code drawn on them is scanned.  Via Wooster Collective.Have a great week!
