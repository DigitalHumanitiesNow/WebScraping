The League of Humanist Makers--Matt Burton, PhD student at the University of Michigan School of Information, and Dave Lester, Masters student at UC Berkeley School of Information, to be exact--have created a jobs archive for digital humanities positions.  Between February 14 and April 10, 38 positions were posted.  Many of the positions require extensive computer programming experience. Individuals are encouraged to post any missing positions.
