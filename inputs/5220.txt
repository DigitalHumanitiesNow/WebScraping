I was attending my son's graduation ceremony at Bournemouth University last week. While waiting for his turn, the title of a graduating student's PhD thesis was read out. It caught my attention (it was about TV production on Dr Who) and so I slipped out my iPhone, googled the student's surname, a word from the title and the name of the university and found the thesis available in the Bournemouth Institutional Repository (first result). I was able to download and start skimreading the PDF before the student had returned to his seat .It's difficult to express what a genuinely exciting experience this was - it felt like I had arrived in the future!   This is a repository use case that I had never thought of, and everything just worked.Congratulations to Bournemouth's repository team on the hard work they have put in to making the experience join up.   Also, congrats to Andrew Ireland on a really interesting thesis!Â PS Universities really should consider letting graduation audiences see some of the really impressive work that their students have done. Perhaps an onstage projection of a poster from their final dissertation while they walk across the stage?
