 Each year, Nicholas Felton releases an personal year report, and the one of 2013 [feltron.com] was just released. These reports always stand out because of the immense sense of data-centric detail, and an always original infographic style.   This year, the report focuses on communication data, as it aspires to uncover patterns and insights within a large collection of tracked conversations, SMS, telephone calls, email, Facebook messages and even physical mail.
