Matt Jockers will discuss his work in place-conscious digital humanities today from 3:30-5 in the Bailey Library. He will speak about research on such questions as how literary expressions about slavery change according to fictional setting, and whether attitudes toward landlords and tenants are different in novels set in Ireland as opposed to novels set in America or England. Using data mined from about 3,500 works of fiction, he makes connections between settings, themes and sentiments to chart ways in which places, such as Ireland, are “invented” in the literary imagination.
