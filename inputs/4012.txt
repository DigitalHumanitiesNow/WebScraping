I am pleasedâand gratefulâto say that this fall Iâll be joining the Department of History and Art History at George Mason University as an assistant professor. Iâll be teaching half my classes on digital history and half on American religious history. In the fall Iâll teach an undergraduate course on church and state in America and a graduate course on computer programming for historians. Over the past few years Iâve been able to get to know some of the people in the department and at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media, and there are many more great people whom I met during my visit and am looking forward to getting to know. I feel fortunate to be joining them as a colleague.
