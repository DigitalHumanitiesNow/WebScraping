Hybrid Pedagogy is a journal of digital and critical pedagogy, online learning, and education. The slides and text below were first assembled by me and Sean Michael Morris for a presentation at the Sloan Consortium Emerging Technologies conference. This presentation focuses on new approaches to scholarly writing, pedagogy, and publishing.The journal itself enacts a hybrid pedagogy. The journal is more than just another online academic journal because it seeks to practice that which it espouses. It enacts its own theory: that all learning is necessarily hybrid. At the journal, we are concerned as much with the writer as her words, as much with the online as with the on-ground, as much with the person as with the tech, and as much with rigor as with imagination. The journal itself is a hybrid between a blog and a journal; and our editors reside in a space somewhere between traditional peer-reviewers and educators. This collections shows off the journalâ€™s content, but many of the pieces here also wear our process openly on their sleeve.      Hybrid Pedagogy Mixtape  from Jesse Stommel
