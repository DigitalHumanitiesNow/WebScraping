The 2010 team of Diggies (Digital Ethnography students) were featured on Upworthy for their “flash mob of kindness” video to support K-State Proud.  Under the title, “A Mob of College Students Attack a Girl With Cancer ant the Results are Life-Changing”, Kim Hohman of Upworthy reports: Weâve just started the process of researching colleges in our house. After watching this video of students attacking other students at Kansas State University, itâs suddenly at the top of my list. Watch the whole video, if you have time, but if not, here are some of the attacks-of-kindness highlights: at :32, they hand out free money; at :54, they cheer for students, just because; at 1:33, they buy someone lunch, then at 1:55, they buy someone books;  they parallel park a car BY PICKING IT UP at 2:57; and at 4:06, meet the girl who had cancer, who was the recipient of a K-State Proud award. The video picked up a quick additional 80,000 viewers since being featured on the site.  And since it was recently posted by Aggieville on Facebook, I’ve been receiving several e-mails from people telling me that they hope their kids come to K-State. Congatulations Diggies of 2010!
