In 2007, my studio Persuasive GamesÂ embarked on a series of newsgames published by the New York Times. It was Kind Of A Big Deal At The Time, because it was the first real attempt for a major newspaper to publish videogames as news content (rather than as puzzles). We completed two games, Food Import Folly, about the effects of reduced FDA inspection resources on food safety, and Points of Entry, on the Merit-Based Evaluation System (aka the “Points-Based Green Card Award System”) in the (later failed)Â McCain-Kennedy ImmigrationÂ bill.Â The games were hidden behind the then-state-of-the-artÂ TimesSelect subscriber paywall, and unfortunately they have beenÂ offline for a long time. I’veÂ restored archived versions that you can play by following the links above. (For what it’s worth, I still contend thatÂ Points of Entry was among the best journalism published anywhere, in any medium on the so-calledÂ Points-Based Green Card Award System, a subject mostly covered elsewhere by cut-and-pastes from Kennedy office press releases.)  2007 doesn’t seem like that long ago, until you think about it. The iPhone was launched that year. The 2008 global financial collapse hadn’t happened. Facebook was three years old, and mostly still used by university students.Â And it was, alas, just a bit too early for the Gray LadyÂ to experiment with newsgames. We were being paid like columnists and hemorrhaging money to produce even the small games we managed to get done. Our editors changed aÂ couple times, and they were really too busy to take onÂ something as new and weird as games. And IT integration was a mess. Eventually, theÂ whole project justÂ evaporatedÂ and disappeared. In theÂ 2010 bookÂ Newsgames: Journalism at Play, my co-authors Simon Ferrari, Bobby Schweizer and IÂ talked a bit about the end of the NYT collaboration. Here’s some of what we said:     In retrospect, Bogost is convinced that the New York Times meant no harm in dropping their arrangement with his studio so suddenly. Rather than wickedness or deceit, organizational politics are likely to blame. As budgets tightened and staff reduced, who could blame an editor for making compromises? Certainly nobody would notice if a videogame didnât makeÂ it onto the Web site. No horseman was deployed to the front of the charge of the newsgames brigade at the New York Times, so the cavalry retired to their desks.     We had more ideas, butÂ editorial desk started rejecting them. AÂ game about gun sale laws and how they encouraged commerce across state lines following the April 2007 Virginia Tech massacre. A gameÂ about the cult of Apple (even back then!) in advance of the iPhone’s release that June. Some of them were better than others, but none of them got made in the end. That summer,Â we hadÂ nearlyÂ finished another game, Steroid Slugger, about the strange politics of steroids in baseball. We wereÂ going to be ready to release it in time forÂ Barry Bonds to pass Hank Aaronâs legendary home run record inÂ August. But before we could, the editorial desk stopped responding to us entirely. The game itself is… well, it’s quite unique, to put it gently, andÂ mildly broken. We never finished it, and its ambitions probably outstripped its reality.Â The idea was to try to present steroidsÂ as an integral part of the modern game of baseball, one driven by the incongruence of fan expectationsÂ andÂ public opinion, as both interacted with the business of the game for managers and commissionersâparticularly in the context of historic records. I think about the game every year when baseball season starts. This year it occurred to me that some might benefit from seeing it, especially as interest in newsgames seems to be on the rise once more. So,Â with apologies forÂ its flaws, almost eight years later, I give youÂ Steroid Slugger toÂ take a swing at. Click the image below to play (Flash required).
