Heather Munro Prescott:Good read from the Dittrick Medical History Museum Originally posted on Dittrick Museum: The recent outbreakÂ  of measles at Disneyland has spurred a rash of competing newscast, blog posts, and social media responses. One question continues to be foremostâas quoted by CNN correspondent Mariano Castillo, âhow bad is it?â Castillo reminds the reader: âto call the news surrounding vaccinations a âdebateâ is misleading. The scientific and medical consensus is clear: Vaccinations are safe, and they work.â [1] The question is not about efficacy but about consequences; parents may have a variety of reasons for not vaccinating their children, sometimes on the grounds of safety or mistrust of the vaccine. However, as pointed out by members of the CDC and others, those who do not vaccinate live in the same communities as those who do; what happens if measles once more establishes a foothold? What might be at stake? History can provide useful parallelsâespecially the history of how vaccines were first administered and why. View original 1,167 more words
