The Cultural Heritage Informatics Initiative invites applications for its 2015-2016 Cultural Heritage Informatics Fellowship program. The Cultural Heritage Informatics Fellowships offer MSU graduate students in departments and programs with an emphasis on cultural heritage (Anthropology, History, Art History, Museum Studies, Historical & Cultural Geography, Classics, etc.) the theoretical and methodological skills necessary to creatively apply information, computing, and communication technologies to cultural heritage materials. In addition, the fellowships provide graduate students with the opportunity to influence the current state of cultural heritage informatics, and become leaders for the future of cultural heritage informatics. During the course of their fellowship (which lasts an academic year), students will collaboratively develop a significant and innovative cultural heritage informatics project. Projects might include (but are certainly not limited to) a serious game, a mobile application, a digital archive, or a collaborative digital publication. To support their work, fellows will receive a stipend of $2000per semester. In addition, fellows will have the opportunity to be appointed as assistants during the Cultural Heritage Informatics Field School (offered during the summer through the Anthropology Department), for which they will receive an additional $1000 stipend. As the fellows will be expected to present their work at professional conferences and meetings, they will receive an additional $1000 in travel funds. All fellows will be in residence atÂ MATRIX: The Center for Digital Humanities & Social Sciences. While applicants may have previous technical experience, such experience is not required to apply. For more information, including eligibility and application requirements, check out theÂ full program description. Deadline for applications is July 6, 5pm EST.
