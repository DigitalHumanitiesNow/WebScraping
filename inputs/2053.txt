Demetrios of Skepsis, a Hellenistic Scholar working in Asia Minor         probably under the sphere of influence of the famous Library of Pergamon, worked on the         Homeric text known as the Trojan Catalogue (Iliad Book 2). This project offers insight into         the scholarly world but from another perspective than the better known Alexandrian one.         This paper will focus on the digital aspects of the project and the issues involved in an online         edition publishing a collection of fragments.
