While I'm taking about Paula, her Historical Methods class (Hist 300) uses weblogs. There are some great posts among the students. Here's a list:  Anderson, Nicholas A. Baber, John B. Byrd, Lori L. Dobbs, Laura N. Hadrick, Kelly M. Klepfel, Keith H. Leahy, Madeliene B. Luu, Nghinh A. McCormack, Brendan Nikitenko, Jazmine L. Perry, Rickita T. Smith, Sarah C. Stewart-Nunes, Sarah If you have time, read a few of the blogs and provide some comments. The class focuses on children's history, and the students have some great research projects in mind.
