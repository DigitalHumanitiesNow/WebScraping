5.25.12 | on ebay Many of you probably use ebay for various reasons but you may not know that historians also use ebay quite a bit. As you may have read in a previous post,Â  I scan ebay for travel ephemera related to my research topic, sometimes coming up with little gems and some times not.Â Â   In preparation for my trip out to Los Angeles to work with the HyperCities folks, I’ve decided to focus this phase of my project on California, a region that is relatively undocumented (in terms of resorts and beaches) compared to the East Coast.Â  I’ve got a few sites and a few photographs but not enough to build out a robust map, so Tod Presner a suggested that I grab some 1940-60s California base maps.Â  I’ve got a list of scholarly sites that have digitized maps to look through, but for the kinds of things I like–itineraries, guidebooks, gas station maps–there is nothing like ebay.  One of the hazards of this kind of research is that you turn up all kinds of things that are sorta related and you kind of want but can’t justify buying, like this AMAZING Table Cloth with a map of the state of California printed on it (only $30!). I am trying very hard to figure out how to work this into my project, so that I might work it into my dining room, but I think I will have to let it go. But my birthday is just a few short weeks away…..
