Â I would prefer some snow to the frigid cold of last week and unseasonable warmth of this week. I declared January Digital History month here at Stillwater Historians in part because I am in the early stages of designing and planning an undergraduate and graduate course which will incorporate digital history and digital tools (more about those later in the semester). Â To wrap up what turned out to be a fabulous month of thought and planning I wanted to provide a set of links that will prove useful as you think about your relationship to and place within the digital humanities.
