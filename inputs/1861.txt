This is the final in a series of posts from Dr Michael Piotrowski, one the recipients of theÂ DM2E Open Humanities Awards – Open track. You can find the final report here.  EuropÃ¤ische FriedensvertrÃ¤ge der Vormoderne online (âEarly Modern European Peace Treaties Onlineâ) is a comprehensive collection of about 1,800 bilateral and multilateral European peace treaties from the period of 1450 to 1789, published as an open access resource by the Leibniz Institute of European History (IEG). The goal of the project funded by the DM2E-funded Open Humanities Award is to publish the treaties metadata as Linked Open Data, and to evaluate the use of nanopublications as a representation format for humanities data.  The Final Countdown  Due to the problems at the outset of the project (see my first blog post), we lost about a month, and with the holiday season in between, it’s hard to catch up. So we’ve always been trailing behind the other projects, or at least that’s what it felt like when reading their status updates.  On Friday we finally got the virtual machine to run our stuff on. We had ordered the VM from our computing center before Christmas, but an acute shortage of personnel our order was delayed by several weeks. We immediately started setting up the software and migrating the data from the development machine to the production server and had it up and running by midnightâ¦  We now have Fuseki running on http://data.ieg-friedensvertraege.de. Since you can’t really âseeâ Linked Open Data, we’ve also set up Pubby, a Linked Data frontend for SPARQL endpoints, which gives the data a friendlier face. For example, the screenshot below shows how the information on the FriedensprÃ¤liminarien von Breslau (in English known as Treaty of Breslau) is presented in Pubby.  Figure 1: Screenshot of Pubby     You may note that there are still some errors, and in fact the published state of the data is not quite final at this pointâwe’re still working on some last-minute issuesâbut it should give you an idea.  Onging Work  Still missing in this version are links to other LOD sources, but these will be there after the next update in a few days.  As I’ve said above, you can’t really âseeâ the data, so there isn’t really much to show; what is exciting is the potential it has for automatic processing. As a very low-key example, the homepage atÂ http://data.ieg-friedensvertraege.de currently shows a âliveâ list of all treaty partners, i.e., when you load the Web page, a query is sent to the SPARQL endpoint to retrieve all entities of typeedm:Agent 1. We’re planning to replace this rather boring list with something more interesting, for example, a map showing the treaty locations, which could look like this:  Figure 2: Mockup of a map display     However, this will need to wait for the next update, because it is currently not possible to automatically retrieve the geographical coordinates of the places, as they’re not yet linked to suitable data sources.  Winding Down  With DM2E coming to an end, this is also the final blog post for this project on this blog; I’ll report on further updates on my personal blog. I’d like to thank the DM2E project for giving me the award, which has made it possible to make some important steps toward opening up historical research data. I’d also like to thank Magnus and his team for doing the âheavy liftingâ in this project.  Footnotes:  1Â See the documentation of the Europeana Data Model (EDM).
