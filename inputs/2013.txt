 This week I was asked to take part in a  meeting about some improvements to the classroom where Emoryâs English  department teaches its graduate courses. Specifically, the department  has decided to make the space âsmartâ by adding a computer and a  projector to the space. As far as I know, this classroom has been one of  the last holdouts on this campus–and certainly in its building–for  adding these tools. Up until this point, the technology of this space  has been limited to a blackboard, a whiteboard, and a 27-inch, CRT  television that hangs precariously in one corner of the room. So the  improvements are certainly welcome. But this meeting wasnât about debating  the technology that would be added. Instead, we were there to think  about how the faculty in the English department could use the new  technology effectively in graduate seminars. Our group met to brainstorm  before giving a presentation to the department on different strategies  they could use, and it represented people heading up a humanities  digital scholarship initiative, librarians, and instructional  technologists. We  had a lively discussion, but at the end we felt a bit stumped. What was getting in our way was the format in which the English graduate seminar  tends to be taught. Speaking from my own experience–at Emory, no  less–English graduate seminars tend to follow a pretty predictable  pattern.[1] Students are assigned to read a primary text–a novel, a  volume of poetry, etc.–and one or more secondary texts–articles,  chapters from one or more books, or a monograph (although this last one  is shockingly rare, as Cathy Davidson  has recently discussed in the ADE Bulletin). The seminar  sessions themselves varied on the faculty member. It wasnât uncommon for  the faculty member to walk in and say, âWell, what did you think?â  (What did I think about reading the complete Wallace Stevens in one  week? Plus two articles? I donât know. I really donât.) Others would  begin by discussing the secondary texts and then move on to the primary  texts. Still others would encourage individual students to take the lead  for a portion of the class, either giving an oral presentation or  speaking about a paper that he or she had written and distributed ahead  of time. Seldom did any of my professors start with anything resembling a  presentation or lecture that covered concepts or history. Any way you  take it, the result is that much of the seminarâs time ends up being  devoted to discussion that is centered around a  couple of texts. But if the discussion  is around a few texts, around their close reading and their discussion  by what can often be very small groups of people, what role is there for  classroom technology, even if it is something basic like a podium  computer and a projector? Obviously, one can use these tools for  displaying films or images. These are certainly germane to the work and  pedagogy of some of the departmentâs faculty members. And if one is  working on electronic literature, then having a computer in the  classroom is certainly advantageous. But what else is there? This is the question  that our group found itself wrestling with, as we tried to think of some  approaches that faculty members could find useful. Hereâs some of the  ideas that we came up with: Skype-ing in guest  speakers: If grad students are reading a couple of current articles,  imagine how interesting it would be to invite the authors of those articles  to participate in a discussion with the class. Not only do students get a  different perspective on the article (although still being wary of  authorial intention), but they would have a chance to make real  connections with people in the field that are outside the institution.  In addition to the authors of secondary material, faculty could also  invite experts on various topics to engage the class in additional  dialog. Co-teaching / co-learning across institutions: Extending the  previous point to perhaps its logical conclusion, one could ask whether  it would be possible to co-teach an entire class with someone at another  institution and to have students enroll from each institution.  Connecting budding scholars not only with advanced persons in the field  but also other budding scholars could only do wonders for the  profession, in my opinion. Enhanced student  presentations: Given the increasing emphasis on professionalization in  the last decade within graduate school, students are more and more aware  that they are enrolling in a PhD program as a stepping stone to having a  particular career. Instead of simply giving an oral presentation in  class, students could practice presentation skills that will be useful  in conferences, classrooms, and job talks. Becoming familiar with tools  such as PowerPoint or Prezi or formats such as Pecha Kucha will help the  students polish what they will need to do on larger stages. As anyone  who has been to an academic conference or attended college can attest,  presentation skills are not bundled with the Ph.D. The more time  students spend speaking in the front of a room and hearing from their  audience, the better they will be at crafting engaging (and therefore  successful) presentations and classes. Social media in the  classroom: Those who know me know that I am very enthusiastic about the  use of Twitter and other social media tools in the undergraduate  classroom. My experience shows that such tools increase participation in  class due to the studentsâ knowing one another better. Once you know  what someone eats for breakfast, it really does become easier to talk  with her about Faulkner. There isnât any reason that graduate students  couldnât make use of similar backchannels within and without the  seminar. Doing the former provides another venue for presenting ideas  and furthering discussion outside the classroom with the inclusion of  what David Siver calls âthick tweets.â There are two  potential limitations to this approach. First, my experience in seminars (which is,  admittedly, five years old at this point) suggests that most English  graduate students donât bring their own computers, opting  instead to take hand-written notes. A cultural shift can alter this, however. Second,  since many seminars are so small (I took one with only the professor,  one other student and myself), there is not necessarily the adequate  numbers required nor the dynamic in place to sustain social media  interactions. Crowdsourcing notes: Those who know me know  that I am even more enthusiastic about Jason Jonesâs wiki-notes  assignment than I am about Twitter. I think thereâs great value in asking students  to collectively decide what was important about the dayâs work in the  classroom. And I would argue that this might be even more important in  the graduate classroom. Since the faculty members from whom I took  classes tended not to present/lecture in the beginning of the seminar, I  often left the seminars not sure if Iâd latched onto the most important  concepts. Having to put into writing what Iâd learned that day would  have been a very useful exercise. Doing it in conjunction with my  classmates would have been still better. Of course, one need not have  classroom technology in place for this assignment. But bold faculty  members could experiment with allowing students to take collaborative  notes about the class within Google Wave or a wiki. Potential  problems with live note-taking could occur if, again, the seminar is  small and/or if the note-taking got in the way of discussions. That  being said, becoming conscious of the âtextâ of the classroom could be  instructive (it has always been so for me) and provide another text to  analyze. Re-thinking the secondary reading assignment: If, as  mentioned previously, Cathy Davidson is right that we do not assign  enough monographs in our graduate seminars, one might rethink how the  secondary reading is assigned with a class. A faculty member could  assign an entire monograph to the class to be read in conjunction with  the primary text. To lighten the load on the students, however, the  faculty member could ask each student to be in charge of individual  chapters and to write summaries of those chapters. These summaries could  be collected in a class wiki that could be referred to throughout the  class. If a professor was worried that there wouldnât be enough common  ground for a discussion, she could ask all the students to read one  chapter and then assign the rest. Doing the work of the  class: While graduate seminars in English tend to be focused on discussions of the  texts at hand, this is not the only activity that takes place, as  mentioned above. Consequently, other uses of technology within the  graduate seminar could include examination of primary materials  (images), facsimile editions (displayed on a document camera), film, doing text mining analysis, or  marking up texts in with TEIâs XML standards. Some  classes, such as University of Maryland, College Park’s Matt Kirschenbaumâs Spring 2008  seminar on simulations, might go so âfarâ as to use Second Life or  games within the classroom and others, such as Yale’s Pericles Lewis’s “Moderns, 1914-1926,” is in part devoted to creating an electronic resource for the study of modernism. Todd Presner of UCLA has his students contribute to geospatial archive and publishing platform Hypercities. Doing the work of the class, in other words,  can be dependent upon particular technologies, especially when  particular technologies (not always the same as those in the previous  clause) are the subject of the course. Apart from this last  point, in which the technology is explicitly a part of the work of the  class–albeit classes that stray from the standard model of the graduate  seminar [1]–Iâm willing to bet that each of these ideas will seem radical  and disruptive to how English seminars are normally taught. But why is  that? I believe that English  seminars are taught not so much to convey information (stuff the  professor knows that the students donât) as they are to teach the  methodologies of literary studies. The most important methodology of  literary studies is the manner of thinking about literature, since it is  this thinking that spurs us on to ask particular questions. The give  and take of the seminar, then, is an exercise in training graduate  students not in particular information but in a particular thinking  method. And since thinking method is the primary research method for  literature students, the seminar room becomes a de facto space for  teaching research methodologies. Using technology in unexpected ways in a  graduate seminar becomes a challenge to the traditions of the  disciplineâs research methodology. The integration of technology into an  English graduate seminar classroom, in other words, poses questions  about how weâre training the next group of scholars, about our pedagogy,  and about how weâve done things for the last X-number of years. This is  not to say that itâs a bad thing. In fact, it might be a very, very  good thing. But I think it underscores why we had such a hard time coming up with  this list and why it will be difficult  for faculty to integrate the new tools into their graduate seminars. But I also know that  my experiences in the English graduate seminar are not universal.[1] And  Iâm willing to bet that many of you have thought of or seen other ways  to integrate technology–even on a very small scale–into the English  graduate seminar. Iâd like to collect as many of these possibilities as I  can in the comments. Both our discussion group and the English  department believe that faculty best learn and innovate by seeing  examples of other things that other faculty are doing. So. How have you imagined  or seen technology transform the English graduate classroom experience? Please share. [1]  Itâs worth noting  that my portrayal of what an English graduate seminar is and looks like  is obviously influenced by my own experiences. Conversations with those  who attended other institutions tend to confirm these experiences. But  Iâm sure that there are also plenty of places where the structures are  very much different from what I perceive to be the ânorm.â
