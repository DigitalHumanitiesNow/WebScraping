The past year was an exciting one for the members of the Digging DH team. We completed phase one of our research, having interviewed over 40 DH scholars about their work, and began to see some of the results through to the presentation stage at both the Digital Humanities Conference in Lausanne, Switzerland, and the Social Media and Society Conference in Toronto, Canada. Both presentations were well-received and the team has submitted them for publication in 2015. Anabel completed the second edition of her book Technology and Society (Oxford: forthcoming). In addition to her daily teaching and research, she was invited to speak at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee at the Social Studies of Information Department onÂ Digital Environments for the Humanities: Exploring the Role of Serendipity and Discovery, and at the University of Toronto as part of the KDMI speaker series on Serendipity models: How we encounter information and people in digital environments. Kim continued work on her PhD Thesis, tentatively titled “Creating context from curiosity: The role of serendipity in the research process of historians”. She was also invited to speak at Ryerson University for Associate University Librarians Day, and gave the keynote lecture Grass/Roots: Notes on a Public Digital Humanities at this year’s ACCESS conference in Calgary, AB. This year Anabel and Kim were also joined by a new Post-Doc on the Digging DH Project. Lori McCay-Peet comes to us from Halifax, where she recently completed her PhD Thesis  entitled “Investigating work-related serendipity, what influences it, and how it may be facilitated in digital environments.” Lori’s knowledge and insights into digital tools will be invaluable as we progress through the publications of several more papers over the coming year.
