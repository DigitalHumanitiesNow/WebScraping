One of the ideas behind âThe Lurkerâ category revolves around how we find things in the digital realm and how we make connections amongst the items we find. Specifically, I am intrigued with how we come to find and make connections amongst the vast array of posts, videos, images, maps, and other digital objects we find that relate to our fields of study and that of our colleagues? I have yet to completely reflect on what I found over the last week of February and the first week of March that relates to my interests in DH and the interests of the students in Humanities 340, and how to visualize and map out those connections. My efforts at using VUE   to help me figure out the connections between what the students were posting as well as the comments those posts elicited did not pan out as I had originally thought it might. So I am back, literally, to the drawing board. Over spring break, I hope to find a better way to map out and visualize the connections between the seemingly random and at times disparate items I find that relate to DH (and quite possibly EH). For now, however, click-on-through and see what connections you think might be found, or not, if there are no connections to be had.
