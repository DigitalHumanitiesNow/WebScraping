Jon got his own hospital room on Tuesday and is no longer a nomad in Montreal General Hospital.  He’s becoming more and more self sufficient, and is going for walks down the hallways of the hospital–not running any races, mind you, but able to ambulate on his own. On Friday his surgeon extraordinaire, Dr. Richard Payne, will be visiting to see how his left vocal chord is doing.  He’s scheduled to be in hospital until at least next Thursday, Feb. 25th.  On Wednesday the 24th, he’s scheduled to get a smaller (thinner) trach tube, which should enable him to swallow more easily and begin to talk a bit.  He needs to have that smaller tube to leave the hospital, and must be able to swallow.  He’s making great strides each day. I’ll have another update Friday, after we talk to Dr. Payne.   –Carrie
