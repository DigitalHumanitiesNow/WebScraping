How to open a NodeXL Workbook created onÂ a different machine By Marc Smith andÂ Derek Hansen Microsoft Office applications have trust issues. When you download a NodeXL workbook from a different machine (perhaps from http://nodexlgraphgallery.org) you may get an error like this one that mentions âtrusted locationsâ.   ************** Exception Text ************** Microsoft.VisualStudio.Tools.Applications.Runtime. CannotCreateCustomizationDomainException:  This document contains custom code that cannot be  loaded because the location is not in your trusted locations list: Sample_Facebook_Egonetwork.xlsx. If you trust this document you can save and open it from a location on your computer. For more information,  see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=99104. ******************************************  This problem is caused by a lack of trust. Excel documents may contain harmful code (âmalwareâ) and the solution Microsoft created was the idea of âTrusted Locationsâ. Only folders that have been identified as âtrusted locationsâ will allow you to open Excel files that run embedded code, which are needed by NodeXL to run. Below are the steps needed to make a folder a trusted location. Once you have done that, NodeXL files stored in that folder will no longer display this error when they are opened. Step 1: Open Excel Options from the File Menu in Excel Select: Excel File Menu>Options  The Excel Options dialog. Select âTrust Centerâ. Step 2: Choose the Trust Center tab on the menu on the left  The Excel Trust Center dialog. Select âTrust Center Settingsâ. Step 3: Add a new trusted location where you will store your NodeXL files  Step 4. The Excel Trusted Locations dialog. Select âAdd new location…â.  The Excel Trusted Location dialog. Enter the path to your NodeXL directory here. Select the âSubfolders of this location are also trustedâ. Select OK to every dialog. It is not recommended that the download directory for your browser be granted Trusted location status. Â This will require NodeXL users to download files and then copy or move them to a Trusted Location in order to open and use the complete NodeXL functionality in the file.
