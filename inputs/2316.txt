 	   		        	   	                    âI learned more on Twitter in six months than in two years of graduate schoolâ is the epigraph of the first chapter of Tom Whitbyâs book (co-authored with Steven W. Anderson), "The Relevant Educator: How Connectedness Empowers Learning." This quote could summarize Whitbyâs philosophy of learning and teaching, in which collaboration is the environment, not just an ingredient, in effective learning. A teacher of English in secondary schools for 34 years and an adjunct professor at St. Josephâs College for six years, heâs officially retired but, you wouldnât know that from his social media activity. Whitby blogs, hosts Twitter chats (@tomwhitby has 58,000 followers and the #edchat community he founded draws hundreds of educators each week), created a Ning (Educatorâs PLN: The Personal Learning Network for Educators), a radio show (Edchat Radio), and a Linked-In group (Technology-Using Professors has 16,000 members). The man walks his talk and talks about his walk in multiple media. I met Whitby at the Tech and Learning Live conference. We sat down, started talking, and when we noticed the time, an hour had gone by. I had known about edchat and had participated a few times. Regular hour-long Twitter chats, organized around a hashtag, are archived on the communityâs wiki. The âconversation that any educator can join to discuss and learn about current teaching trends, how to integrate technology, transform their teaching, and connect with inspiring educators worldwideâ was founded by Whitby, my own PLN guru, (@shellterrell), and Steven W. Anderson. Itâs an entry to multiple personal learning networks for educators who are interested in the pedagogical as well as technological aspects of connected learning. In our 12-minute video conversation, we talked about how we are preparing teachers to teach today and how teachers can use a wide variety of social media to learn, collaborate, and lead through personal learning networks.
