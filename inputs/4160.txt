I thought I'd test out the new rubric on a popular museum game called Waltee's Quest. Created by the Walters Art Gallery in 2008 to "engage audiences and foster recreational learning,"  this game won some awards in 2009 so let's see how it holds up to assessment.Waltee's Quest is a hidden object game (HOG) and opens with a cut scene that introduces the player to the game quest and the mascot, Waltee.  The player enters a steam-punk inspired elevator and rides to magical rooms where they click on objects to find them. Each room has a different theme and the artwork is fantastic, in fact,  it is the best part about the game. Each room is so enchanting that it almost makes you forget that there really isn't much game play or educational content.  What content there is you will find embedded in a Walteepedia (aka digital book) that players may click on to learn more - but there is no incentive for them to do so.  Scoring lets players know how many objects they have collected but is not related to learning or assessment. There are also secret buttons that will open up a casual game in each room (ie. matching games and mazes) but again these games are not connected to any cognitive learning outcomes. The hidden object game mechanic and matching games may help with basic visual literacy skills somewhat but, since the player doesn't really need to look or interact with the objects, this would be little more then the ability to recognize.  The player also has a treasure list that could teach players some very basic vocabulary; however, the hint system of illuminating the correct objects when clicked is so obvious that there is actually no need to consult the list.Waltee's Quest is a game I really wanted to like but  left me a little disappointed in the end [note:  I am well beyond their target demographic so take my comments with a grain of salt].  At first, I was so excited about the look of the game but quickly became disenchanted. Firstly, I had  constant problems with the game freezing, handles not working, scrolling not working, casual games not loading, etc.  Secondly, the game play is rudimentary, even for 12 and under, and not integrated with educational content, it's almost more of an elaborate interactive web site than game. Overall, the game is great as a web tool for viewing part of the museum's online collection and may function within the affective domain to engage new audiences. As far as I'm aware, there has been no research conducted or published as to how this game might change player attitudes towards museums. Overall, this game scored 26% based on the educational game rubric (see below).I think that this rubric needs some tweaking so I'm going back to the drawing board and will return soon with a new and improved version. I'd like to also assess things like  narrative structure and integration, game "juiciness" - a term a learned from Jesper Juul's, A Casual Revolution, and thematic content.Game Name:  Waltee's Quest         Institution:  Walters Art Gallery         Genre  Hidden Object Game         Demographic  Kids under 12           Date  2008           Company  Planit, Inc. and The Walters Art   Museum       http://walteesquest.com/                                         Exemplary  Proficient  Partially Proficient  Incomplete  Points   Category  3  2  1  0   1  Engagement  Game is age appropriate, highly   engaging and fun  Game is age appropriate,   moderately engaging and fun  Game is age appropriate, somewhat   engaging and fun  Game is not fun, engaging or age   appropriate  2 2  Complete, Correct and Well-Rounded   Content  Presents the player with a   complete and balanced set of correct knowledge from the subject area.  Presents the player with an almost   complete, correct and balanced set of knowledge.  Presents the player with some   correct knowledge.  Provides no knowledge or what is   provided is incomplete, incorrect or biased.  1 3  Focused on the Topic  Consistently stays focused on the   relevant educational topic and associated processes  Focuses on the topic and processes   most of the time. Includes some superfluous content.  Focuses on the topic and processes   some of the time.  Includes a lot of superfluous content.  Content and game play are   disconnected from one another.  0 4  Content and game play integration  Content is fully expressed through   game play  Content is somewhat expressed   through game play  Content is expressed through text   blocks and quizzes  Content is expressed in text   screens and setting only, not incorporated into gameplay  0 5  Feedback  Scoring supports player formative   assessment and learning.  Scoring is connected to learning   but unclear or inconsistent  Scoring allows player to   understand their progress but does not help shape learning.  Scoring is not connected to   content provides no feedback for player improvement  1 6  Encourages Active Player   Participation  Player must contribute a lot of   effort to progress through the game, and the game encourages and supports the   efforts of the player  Player must contribute some effort   to progressing through the game and the game encourages these efforts.  Player must contribute very little   effort to progress through the game and the game provides no encouragement to   continue playing.  Player can progress through the   game without any effort (like watching a movie).  1 7  Problem Solving  The player must actively solve   problems to progress through the game using knowledge and information   gathered from previous game play tasks.  The player must refine solutions   to problems from suggestions given in the game.  The player must select a solution   to a problem from a set of choices given by the game.  The player does not need to solve   problems to progress.  0 8  Genre  Genre is appropriate for the   player to get the most value from the game.  Genre is not the best that could   be used but still provides suitable value.  Genre has not been chosen   appropriately however the game has some value.  Inappropriate and inhibits the   value of the game.  3 9  Integration of game play and   content  Game play is built around the knowledge   and/or processes of the domain and hence highly connected.  Some of the game play is linked to   domain knowledge.  None of the game play is linked to   domain knowledge however the player gets a sense of how it could.  The game play has nothing to do with   the domain knowledge.  1 10  Assessment  Evaluating the playerâs domain   knowledge level is directly connected with challenges in the game.  Most of the challenges in the game   test the players knowledge of the domain.  Some of the challenges in the game   test the players knowledge of the domain.  None of the challenges in the game   test the players knowledge of the domain.  0 11  Interoperable  Game includes an interface to   existing CMS or LMS (i.e. is SCORM or IMS compliant)  Has an interface to import and   export data but only in proprietary format.
