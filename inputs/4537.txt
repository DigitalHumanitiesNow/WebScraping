Not being from the medical or surgical field, we cannot understand the details of plastic surgery on which plastic surgeons have to work upon, before entering the operation theater. A common man is aware of this fact only that with the help of facial plastic surgery a deformed face can be given a brand new look. But folks there are various types of facial plastic surgical procedures available and each type of surgery done on a different part of the face has its unique terminology. So, for your help and consideration I have listed the different types of facial plastic surgery available today: 1) Facial Scar Revision. 2) Blepharoplasty (Surgery of the Eyelids). 3) Otoplasty (Surgery of the Ears). 4) Botox injections. 5) Rhinoplasty (Surgery of the Nose). 6) Forehead Lifts.  7) Skin Resurfacing. 8) Mentoplasty (Surgery of the Chin). 9) Wrinkle Treatment. 10) Rhytidectomy (Surgery of the Face). 11) Hair Replacement. 12) Liposuction. Point to Be Noted: Few facial surgeries can easily be done by giving patient local anesthesia. For instance, chin surgery or menthoplasty can be done without giving patient local anesthesia. Unless, it is essential to obtain bone from another part of the body then in such situation, general anesthesia is used. According to the reviews of the experts of http://dallaseyeandear.com/facial.html, plastic chin surgery includes the simple insertion of an implant, by doing an incision underneath the chin or in the mouth. Usually, such type of facial surgery is very successful, even though a nerve can get damaged, producing numbness and lack of mobility of the lower lip either provisionally or in very rare cases, permanently.     The post Facial Cosmetic Surgery Beneficiaries appeared first on Carpinto.
