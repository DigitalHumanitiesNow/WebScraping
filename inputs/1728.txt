During my very first semester at MIT, I worked on a project with three awesome fellow grad students, Suruchi Dumpawar, Erik Stayton, and Yu Wang. We were asked to come up with a solution for the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority to improve the T subway rider experience. Our proposal was the aptly/awfully titled Art Traffickr, a playful system that allows users to virtually collect objects from the Museum of Fine Artâs collection. (Weâre still working on rebranding.) Iâm finally sharing our design brief from the project here.tl;dr: Art Traffickr is a project concept that enables MBTA riders to capture digital objects from the Museum of Fine Artâs collection on their mobile phones. The project consists of three interfaces: public displays of collection items available at each station, a mobile application that allows a user to capture an object from the collection, and a kiosk at the MFA where museum visitors can create digital works that will, in turn, enter into the digital collection distributed at T stations. By having users temporarily âownâ digital versions on the museumâs collection, we aim to cultivate a sense of ownership and exclusivity, dynamic discovery and interconnectedness, and ephemerality that contribute to a fun and unique rider experience.Â ConceptArt Traffickr creates a dialogue between the digital collection of a museum and MBTA riders. An interactive display in each T station invites riders to collect digital objects on their phones, introducing an element of discovery and exploration to the ridership experience. There are few interesting themes that this project taps into:Ownership and exclusivityâThe digital collection mirrors the physical MFA collection in a key way: only one version of the digital object exists within the T system. In effect, weâve created a false scarcity; the digital platform allows us to make endless copies of the digital objects, but the limited number of artworks available is what entices a rider to participate. Thus, when a rider picks up an object on their phone, he or she is the only one that âownsâ the object at that time. Additionally, objects can only be picked up at MBTA stations, creating a perk exclusive to MBTA riders.Dynamic discovery and interconnectednessâRiders can choose an artwork from the set of objects available in the station at the time, allowing them to discover different artworks each time they ride the T. The works available in a station depend on what artworks other people have left behind, creating a sense of dynamism and interconnectedness among riders. Additionally, each object will track where it has been and which users have previously acquired it. Just as museums keep a record of an artworkâs provenance (a.k.a. who has previously owned the work), so too will the digital MBTA collection track a digital objectâs provenance.EphemeralityâAfter a user has âownedâ an object for three days, it will fade from the userâs phone, returning back to the MBTA digital collection. This ephemerality ensures that objects will continue circulating among riders. Additionally, the sense of ephemerality also creates a sense of precious time with an object. Just as the limited number of objects serves to entice each rider to collect an artwork, so does an objectâs ephemerality make the time with the object all the more special.Democratizating art productionâWhile the digital collection will initially consist of only works in the MFAâs collection, we proposed that members of the metropolitan Boston community have the opportunity to contribute to the collection as well. Visitors to the physical museum can create a work of art on an iPad or a digital kiosk during their visit. This kiosk can be integrated into an exhibition or learning space as the MFA pleases; for example, the MFA may choose to have visitors respond to a prompt or an artwork on view. After creating their artwork, visitors submit the artwork along with any relevant information (artist name, title, and date). Museum professionals then vet the artworks before they enter into the digital collection. We hope this will incentivize Art Traffickr users to visit the museum in order to submit an artwork as well as create a bridge between the physical space of the museum and the digital collection in the T stations.(Why yes, I didÂ own one of these binders as a child…source)InspirationThis project was inspired by two overarching concepts: trading cards and âleave a book, take a bookâ libraries. Whether baseball or Pokemon fanatics, trading card owners form a community around collecting and exchanging objects with images and information. We aim to channel the feeling that goes along with finding the elusive card youâve spent so long searching for. âLeave a book, take a bookâ libraries are also based on the element of exchange. We are interested in the reciprocity of one-to-one exchange that book-swap stations facilitate. These informal libraries create a sense of community even when people are not physically interacting with each other.(source)We also looked to other programs and projects as sources of inspiration. MITâs List Center for the Visual Arts provides a democratizing model of art that guided our vision. The Student Loan Art Program lends works of art to MIT students for a year. Paul Ha, director of the List, stated in a video: âAs a museum, our main role is to put a person in front of an art object…The student actually gets to be a collector.â Through media, we hope to similarly distribute the MFAâs collection among the local publicâonly digitally. The National Vending Machine, a project of the Dutch Museum of National History, similarly transforms visitors into collectors. Visitors can use the vending machine-like installation to purchase an affordable common object and learn about its historical background and how it relates to Dutch culture. We are interested in creating a similar opportunity to own a museum object.(source)Tateâs Gallery of Lost Art inspired us to incorporate a sense of ephemerality in our project. The Gallery of Lost Art was an online exhibition about ephemeral, missing, and destroyed works. After a year, the exhibition, much like the artwork it discuss, disappeared from the web. This was intentional: âWe wanted the site to have the salient characteristics of an in-gallery exhibition; of these, finiteness was, we judged, crucial. It is part of the drama of in-gallery exhibitions and a major factor driving people to make the requisite efforts to go visit them. Ending the site mimicked and underscored the loss of the works of art that were its subject.â Similarly, we hope to infuse a sense of scarcity and ephemerality that mimics the physical collection.(source)As a final, rather bizarre source of inspiration, we looked to I Am Rich, an iOS application that was available for a day in 2008 on the App Store. The application consisted solely of an image of a red diamond; the price tag? $999.99. Eight people purchased the application before it was pulled from the App Store. We are interested in the aura of exclusivity around the app. Functionally, the app was useless, but the fact that it was available only to those few willing to pay the absurd fee was what made the app enticing to users.PersonaArt Traffickr is intended to be used by the local community that regularly commutes using the T. We envision two types of users: frequent MBTA riders who will collect and swap out objects on their mobile phones, and visitors to the museum who choose to create works of art that will be entered into the digital collection. For the MBTA riders, we hope to address several needs. First, this project will provide a simple but fun activity to do while they wait for their train. The riders can learn about their object as they ride the train, providing something for users to do during long commutes. Additionally, the interactions between a user, his or her phone, and the public displays will create a link between riders and the physical space of the station. Instead of just staring at their own phones, now users will be oriented to the shared collection in the station, creating a sense of community even without having strangers directly interacting with each other.Enabling TechnologyThe app and public screen would detect transfers by taking advantage of tap position on the screen and device accelerometer data in the vein of bump-to-transfer applications. A camera or infrared camera setup such as Kinect placed above the screen will be used to detect the locations where devices are tapped. The smartphone application will use accelerometer data to determine when a phone is tapped against a surface, and GIS information will identify at which station it is located. By combining the time and location of screen tap as determined by the cameras, and the phoneâs location and accelerometer data, a unique transfer request can be identified between devices. Though the flow of objects will be largely determined by users, distribution algorithms will track traffic and adjust the total number of available items at a station. As items fade through lack of user interest, the same set of algorithms can replace these with other objects in the collection.
