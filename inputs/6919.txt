We’re delighted to see Writing History in the Digital AgeÂ has been listed on the digitalculturebooks siteof the University of Michigan Press and MPublishing as forthcoming in Fall 2013. Also, University of Connecticut librarian and digital humanities advocate Anna Kijas shared this link to a presentationÂ (see also YouTube video) she recently delivered that mentions our volume, in the context of her own scholarship and open-source publishing tools such as CommentPress, Omeka, and Neatline. Documenting Teresa CarreÃ±o, the project discussed in her presentation, will be viewable online shortly.
