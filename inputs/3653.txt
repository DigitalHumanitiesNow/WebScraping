(coauthored with Tara Rodgers) âThe Poetics of Signal Processing,â Differences 22:2-3 (Summer/Fall 2011): 31-53.  Audio examples here. The electronic copy’s not up on any database to which McGill gives me access, and the hard copy has a binding error where pp 61-76 appear between pages 44 and 45.  That’s a first. This is a very exciting and intense semester for me.  Lots of writing, research and travel since I’m not teaching any regular courses (they owed me some course releases from my time as chair and from some grants).  I’ll write more about that in the coming days and weeks.
