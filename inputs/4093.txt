Colin Thom is a Senior Historian with the Survey of London, the closest thing to an ‘official’ history of the capital, now part of English Heritage’s Department of Heritage Protection. He has contributed to the Survey’s ongoing series of detailed studies of the capital’s architecture and topography for more than 20 years. He is also the author of Researching London’s Houses (Historical Publications, 2005), an archives usersâ guide to the subject, and lectures and publishes regularly on all aspects of the capital’s history. He acted as Project Officer for English Heritage (EH) during the joint EH / IHR project to make the Surveyâs volumes freely available in digital form via BHO. Colin will identify and help convene the user focus group with colleagues at English Heritage, and help with the evaluation of the prototype revisions to the service.
