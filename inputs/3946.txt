Progress Update #3 – Arduino Datalogger This will be a short update, since all there is to report is that the proof-of-concept phase is done on time – successfully! The bench test was successful. The unit worked continuously for nearly two weeks, without any issues other than a brief dog-related power outage. later this week, I will present the proof-of-concept unit at the Electronics for the Rest of Us II wrap-up session. Next step will be to clean up the breadboard and build and program the second unit for a two-week field test to be conducted at McMasterâs Mills Memorial Library during the month of May.
