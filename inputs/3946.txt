Hastily, as I prepare for our very own THATCamp CHNM, I wanted to bring our attention to some great new features we rolled out today, thanks to developer Boone Gorges.Participad (actually rolled out several days ago) has been enabled so that THATCampers can take notes collaboratively right in the WordPress interface without having to use Google Docs.There’s a new THATCamps Directory that’ll let you find THATCamps by region and/or date and will let you search for THATCamps by name.The home page of thatcamp.org now displays the start date, end date, and location of upcoming THATCamps.You can subscribe to a feed of New THATCamps by RSS or by email via the buttons on the home page of thatcamp.org.All THATCamp sites allow users to befriend one another.All THATCamp sites allow users to favorite blog posts. Visitors can see how many favorites a post has received, site administrators can see a list of the most-favorited posts on their THATCamp site, and network administrators can see a list of the most-favorited posts on all THATCamp sites on thatcamp.org. This is a feature that’ll help us immensely as we finally get ready to produce the long-awaited Proceedings of THATCamp.The THATCamp Registration form that lets people sign up to go to a THATCamp now has options for “Days Attending” and for “T-shirt Size” to help organizers plan.Very soon, we’ll also enable an automatic THATCamp Registry that will automatically create a website for people who say, Hey, yeah, I want to organize a THATCamp! No more waiting for the sluggish THATCamp Coordinator to do it for you manually. We’ll be writing some help documentation for these features soon and will be fine-tuning how they work — send comments and suggestions to me at *protected email*. Though I won’t promise to answer until next week.
