[This post originally appeared at ProfHacker.] Weâve written a lot about plain text at ProfHacker, from an introduction to Markdown, to using Pandoc, to creating slides from plain text. One thing Iâd like to be able to do with plain text is this: Often Iâd like to grab some text from a website in plain text. Copying and pasting into a text editor loses links and italics, while pasting into a word processor brings a lot of junk formatting with it. Itâd be nice to be able to copy a websiteâs text in Markdown. Brett Terpstra, the creator of nvALT (another ProfHacker favorite), has created a website to do just that. His Markdownifier converts a website to plain text, preserving the essential formatting in Markdown.  The service has a few useful features. It can use Readability to strip out all the extraneous formatting. A button will copy the Markdown to your clipboard. And the site offers several bookmarklets so that you can easily use it on any website.
