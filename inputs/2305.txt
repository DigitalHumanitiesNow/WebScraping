   We are less than 2 months away from theÂ Winter quarter, and enrollments are open at UCR and across the UC campuses for the online version of History 99W. The course Â is “The Historian’s Workshop”, an in it, I use zombies to introduce studentsÂ to historical methods. If you want to know how I do it, take the course! Or check the syllabus out. It’s all posted at the enrollment site here. The zombie theme Â won’t come as a surprise to anyone who knows me – and forÂ the online version of the course (renumbered for arcane reasons to History 19WV) we are usingÂ one textbook only: Max Brooks’ World War Z. All other readings are available within the course site to enrolled students. There’ll beÂ primary source readings, and online archivesÂ to explore and comment on, and two large research projects. PleaseÂ take a look atÂ the first research assignmentÂ here: digitalzombies.ucr.edu.  The course is open to UCR students, all UC students, and non-UC students. More info on cross-campus enrollmentÂ hereÂ .
