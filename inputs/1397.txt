Yes, I know I promise to post only DH related stuff, but, ehi after the second person that tells me that my Tom Yum recipe is great, I though to share it. The initial inspiration comes from a book of Thai recipes from Blue Elephant, then I added a few things myself. 400ml chicken stock400 ml coconut milk40gr galangal (or ginger) finely sliced1 stem lemongrass, finely sliced4 kaffir lime leaves crushed200 gr chicken breast cut into thin slices100gr mushrooms, quartered,5 green chilies crushed4tbsp fish sauce4tbsp tamarind juice2tsbp lemon juicesprinkling coriander leaves I also normally add: 200 gr pak choi1 bag (400 gr?) of bean sprouts 2 peppers finely slicedPut all ingredients but chicken, mushrooms, bean sprouts, chilies and lemon into a pot. Bring to boil, add the rest of ingredients a part for lemon and cook for 5 mins. Add lemon, boil for a second (!) then take out from the heat and add coriander (I don't: coriander tastes of soap!).Enjoy!
