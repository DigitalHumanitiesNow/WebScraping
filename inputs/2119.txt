The Grand Canyon is yet another place that Google brings to your digital screens, from their Street View family of content. Google has been collecting street-level views of our world at a vast scale possible only because of it’s deep pockets and technical expertise.Â   Trekker is aÂ wearable backpack outfitted with a camera system on top. It’s portability enables Google to gather images while maneuvering through tight, narrow spaces or locations only accessible by foot. The Trekker is operated by an Android device and consists of 15 lenses angled in a different direction so the images can be stitched together into 360-degree panoramic views. As the operator walks, photos are taken roughly every 2.5 seconds. See a view of theÂ Bright Angel Trail. Read more at Google’s blog announcement.  Trolley goes into museums. GoogleÂ developed a push-cart system that could easily fit through museum doorways and navigate around sculptures. Here are views ofÂ several museums Google has covered.  Snowmobile was another hack,Â put together over the course of a few weekends (they say) using some 2x4s, duct tape, and extra hard drives wrapped in ski jackets to last through the freezing conditions. Motivated by the 2010 Winter Olympics, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada — the snowmobileÂ mapped slopes and trails which fans would be seeing during the games.  Trike is a three-wheel bicycle developed in 2009 for recording fromÂ parks and trails, university campuses, theme parks, zoos, monuments, sports stadiums, and the like. For these locations, which are often private land, Google signs a deal with the location. They have a submission form for new locations, which is highly overbooked.  Cars were Google’s first step into street views, launching in 2007 with 5 U.S. cities, and now deliveringÂ 360Â° panoramic views from locations worldwide. Starting with an SUV, then a van, Google settled on a fleet of cars. The latest car has 15 lenses taking 360 degrees of photos. It also has motion sensors to track its position, a hard drive to store data, a small computer running the system, and lasers to capture 3D data to determine distances within the Street View imagery. A related project takes underwater panoramas, such as a view ofÂ Lady Elliot Island, QLD, Australia. Check out Google’s gallery of some of their best street view collections. Hopefully they will continue to connect more of our world.
