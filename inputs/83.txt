SEK wanders out of THE BAR after saying many fond farewells one of his oldest friendsÂ only to find THE COP hunched over the side of his car in what appears to be a puking position.  SEK:Â Are you all right? THE COP:Â Fine, fine -- just had a bad Sprite. SEK:Â I don't think that's a thing. THE COP:Â Must have been bad. SEK:Â Are you sure you're alright? THE COP:Â (grabbing his side) Yeah sure -- you can just -- I can -- SEK:Â Bad Sprite's not a thing. When my wife grabbed her side like that she had to have her appendix re -- THE COP:Â I'll be -- I'm -- just you -- SEK:Â I'm calling 911. (calls 911) I'm with a police officer and he's in a lot of pain -- 911 DISPATCHER:Â Where are you located? SEK:Â I'm at [location] THE COP'S CAR:Â Officer [In Extremis] are you OK? THE COP:Â (moans) 911 DISPATCHER:Â Is the officer OK? SEK:Â He doesn't seem to be. Should I tell the person in the car that? THE COP:Â I'M OK! SEK:Â He's not. Don't listen to him. 911 DISPATCHER:Â Keep him still -- help is coming.  SEK looks at THE COP, who is now moaning on the ground in pain not borne of bad Sprite.  SEK:Â I'm -- on it? 911 DISPATCHER:Â This is on you now. Keep him talking. SEK:Â So tell me more about this bad Sprite...
