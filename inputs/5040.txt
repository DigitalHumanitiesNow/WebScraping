 Join a panel of Book Industry Study Group (BISG) and American Library Association (ALA) leaders at this yearâs 2015 ALA Annual Conference in San Francisco when they discuss the results of a newly-released study on public library patronsâ use of digital content. During the conference session âDigital Content in Public Libraries: What Do Patrons Think?â panelists will discuss the results of a new study by the BISG and ALA that was designed to provide invaluable insight into how readers interact with e-books in a library environment. The session takes place from 3:00 to 4:00 p.m. on Sunday, June 28, 2015, at the Moscone Convention Center in room 131 of the North Building. The digital content survey was developed to understand the behavior of library patrons, including their use of digital resources and other services offered by public libraries. The study examined the impact of digital consumption behaviors, including the adoption of new business models, on library usage across America.
