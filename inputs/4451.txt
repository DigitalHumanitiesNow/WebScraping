“The experience of reading poetry aloud when you donât fully understand it is a curious and complicated one. Itâs like suddenly discovering that you can play the organ. Rolling swells and peals of sound, powerful rhythms and rich harmonies are at your command; and as you utter them you begin to realize that the sound youâre releasing from the words as you speak is part of the reason theyâre there. The sound is part of the meaning, and that part only comes alive when you speak it.” ~ Philip Pullman, Foreword toÂ Paradise Lost, by John Milton
