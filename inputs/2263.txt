   Pierre Mounier, Teacher at Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, EHESS (Paris, France) and Associate Director of the Center for open electronic publishing (ClÃ©o) will teach two courses on HypothÃ¨ses.org  at University of Pisa Wednesday 20 March 2013 and at the European University Institute in Florence, the  following day, Thursday 21 March. Both sessions will be free of charge.The French academic blogging portal HypothÃ¨ses.org  from 2012 has become European, with new language sections in German,  Spanish and Portuguese. The challenge is now to open an Italian section  of the Portal, HypothÃ¨ses.it and why not a federal European one like  âhypothÃ¨ses.euâ here at the European University Institute in Florence? What we would need is a server and  somebody to maintain it and, of course scholars wishing to participate  in such an active and variegate online scholarly community in the  Social Sciences and Humanities.The workshop about HypothÃ¨ses.org is organized by the University of Pisa, âLaboratorio di Cultura Digitaleâ together with the âCorso di Laurea Magistrale in Informatica Umanisticaâ and the EUI in Florence.  The video of the first session in  Pisa will be made available on both the Pisa University web site and also on the  iTunesUniversity platform. These seminars are also organized with the support of the national Italian association for Digital Humanities, the Associazione Informatica Umanistica e Cultura Digitale. Mounier will teach scholars how to create a scientific blog and enter the important discussion that is taking place in the USA ,-and not only,- about how to evaluate the scientific contents offered in academic blogs, a relatively new form of narrative and writing that many specialized scholars are choosing today to communicate with their public. They are looking at platforms like HypothÃ¨ses.org or, instead, they decide to open their own personal blog without the benefit of such an important scholarly context, a wider portal in the social sciences and humanities. How to evaluate the scientific contents of the blog is a challenge in the academic environment today will be a key issue discussed in Pisa and Florence. But before that, everybody should be familiar with the Content Management System WordPress which is used by Pierre Mounier to show you how to proceed with the HypothÃ¨ses.org CMS. The organizers are hoping that many people will attend either the session in Pisa or the one in Florence and open their own blogs after this introduction by Pierre Mounier. WHEN & WHERE ?
