Open “Algorritmos: Infopoemas” by E. M. de Melo e Castro Since 1986, besides videopoetry, E. M. de Melo e Castro worked on a series of experiments with other computer media (suportes informÃ¡ticos), coined by the author as âinfopoesiaâ [infopoetry], in which he used image editor software. Once more â and this is a fact the analysis by Jorge Luiz Antonio (2001) does not highlight â the prevailing choice of image editors at the expense of word processors reveals the visual affiliation of Castrian poetics. The infopoemsâ visual animations acknowledge pixel as the primary unit of meaning, in the perspective of an infopoetic language. Some of the resulting images were published in Finitos Mais Finitos: FicÃ§Ã£o/FicÃ§Ãµes [Finite Plus Finite: Fiction/Fictions] (1996) and Algorritmos: Infopoemas [Algorythms: Infopoems] (1998), whose initial essay develops âa pixel poeticsâ and explains the amalgams created in the title. The quest for transgression, which is underlined by the bookâs title (1998), is followed by the quest for formal synthesis: (…) a fixaÃ§Ã£o em papel ou noutro suporte (â¦) dessas imagens virtuais que sÃ£o energia luminosa, sÃ£o apenas atualizaÃ§Ãµes instantÃ¢neas de um momento da sua existÃªncia. SÃ£o mesmo uma violÃªncia exercida pelo operador contra a natureza transformÃ¡vel e instÃ¡vel dos infopoemas, cuja razÃ£o serÃ¡ uma constante transformaÃ§Ã£o, atÃ© atingirem o nÃ­vel da sÃ­ntese Ãºltima de um Ãºnico PIXEL branco numa tela branca. Branco sendo a sÃ­ntese de todas as cores. LUZ. (Melo e Castro 1998: 13) [(â¦) the fixation on paper or other media (â¦) of those virtual images, which are luminous energy, are merely instantaneous updates from a moment of their existence. They are even a violent act performed by the operator against the infopoemsâ transformable and unstable nature, whose reckoning will be a steady transformation until they reach the ultimate synthesis level of a single white PIXEL on a white screen. White is the synthesis of all colors. LIGHT.] (SeiÃ§a trans.) From the Brazilian working phase, another set of chromatic infopoems is available here, in which E. M. de Melo e Castro further explores the creative potential of word as image and image as word, in a series of transformations operated with software.
