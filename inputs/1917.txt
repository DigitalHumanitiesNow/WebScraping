I was very pleased to be invited, a month or so ago, to be a contributor to the Critical Code Studies blog (maintained by Mark C. Marino at usc).  In fact, I was so pleased that I actually wrote something, which, although it probably diminishes the overall quality of the discussion considerably, nonetheless expresses my hope that just as literary studies began (according to one pataphysical genealogy) with belles-lettres, so critical code studies might have its own tradition of bit-lettristic writing.  I have a lot more to say on that subject, actually, but it will have to wait.  I am so very, very far from inbox zero.  The essay is called, âTim Toady Bicarbonate.â
