  If you saw me last week, I was running on caffeine and junk food, but it was worth it: I co-organized the hackathon portion of Hacking Arts, a three-day event exploring the intersection of the arts and technology. I wrote about Hacking Arts and reflected on how museums might be able to throw similar events over on Museum Making.
