Today is the Day of Digital Humanities 2014, an open community publication project designed to document digital humanities practices around the world. This year, like last year, it is being hosted by our friends at Matrix, who is also, of course, partnering with us on the Public Philosophy Journal. Throughout the day I will be posting content related to various facets of my academic and administrative life associated with the Digital Humanities. My definition of digital humanities is brief and expansive: the digitally mediated practice of the Humanities. This articulation advocates for the humanities itself as a practice. More than a set of disciplines, the humanities is an endeavor: the ongoing attempt to act and think in ways that do justice to the complexity of humanity so as to enrich human culture and community. As mediated by the digital, this endeavor takes on new, powerful capacities of publicness and collaboration, even if it also runs the risk of losing itself in a vast sea of data with its cross-currents of disconnected information. My work in the digital humanities includes but extends beyond my academic scholarship in Philosophy to my work in higher education administration and ultimately to my family and personal life where digital media enable me to cultivate habits of mindfulness. With this definition in hand, I include in my Long Day of DH 2014 posts about my academic and administrative life punctuated by moments of mindfulness designed to remind us that it is the human that brings the digital to life. I invite you to follow along on my Day of DH 2014 Blog: A Long Day of DH and to follow #DayOfDH on Twitter.
