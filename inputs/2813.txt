My first foray into video production and just in time for Halloween too. Technical notes: Zombie video clips were taken from Night of the Living Dead (1968), available in the public domain from the Internet Archive. Background music and sound effects from Sound Bible (public domain). Screencasts created with CamStudio.Everything sewn together using Microsoft's Windows Live Movie Maker (free).
