I’ve been enjoying my travel immensely, and walking around Berlin today I thought perhaps I should blog more about my trips various places, since that’s probably more interesting than some of the stuff I do write about. For instance, today I wandered off the street and into a gallery only to discover that they were featuring CÃ©leste Boursier-Mougenot’s finches piece.  While it’s cool to see online, in the gallery it is a whole other level of amazing.  You can walk into the exhibit and hang out with them.  They are beautiful birds.  At first they didn’t know what to do with me, but after awhile they got used to me and started hopping on the guitars again.  Toward the end a family came in and again they stayed higher for awhile before again returning to the guitar playing.   In other news, Anthony ParÃ© has a op-ed in today’s Montreal Gazette that sums up very well my frustrations with the official communiques we get from upper administration about the strike.
