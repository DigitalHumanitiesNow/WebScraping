 Lee Rainie, director of the Pew Internet Research Center was interviewed by Bob Garfield on OnTheMedia this week about the recently releasedÂ report on mapping Twitter topic networks. Â The report found six distinct patterns of social media networks in Twitter: divided, unified, fragmented, clustered, and in and out hub and spoke patterns. They discuss the prospects for overcoming polarization in social media and the hopeful signs that many other forms of social network structures exist in addition to the divided network pattern.  http://www.connectedaction.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/20140314-OnTheMedia-Twitter-Cartography-with-Lee-Rainie.mp3
