In this poster session, we present the project of the Public Philosophy Journal and our plans for cultivating a community of engaged scholars to sustain it.  At the session, we explain our motivations for designing the journal to perform public philosophy as its mode of publication, highlight the journalâs role as a hub for community-sourced curation and open peer review of existing work, and introduce our model for the collaborative writing and editing of publicly engaged scholarship.  We draw attention to common aims of differing conceptions of public philosophy, and discuss how the PPJ will leverage digital media in promoting both reasoned deliberation concerning the public good and the modeling of virtues of thought, expression, and action within the public sphere. Here is the poster itself, designed in collaboration with Matrix at Michigan State: Public Philosophy Journal Poster for DH2014
