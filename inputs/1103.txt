For the past few weeks, a "Design is..." meme has exploded, where designers have been creating desktops promoting what they think "design" is. In a similar spirit, I thought it would be cool to think about what "History is..." and make a desktop for it. The first thing that came to mind is "History is a Perpetual Beta." I've argued previously on ClioWeb, and on an AAHC conference panel, that history, like many Web 2.0 applications, is in a perpetual "beta," or in a constant state of testing, revision, and improvement. So, to spice up your computer's desktop:    Download:  1024x768 1280x1024 1440x900 1600x1200 I'm also taking requests to do a "History is..." desktop image. What do you think history is? Leave a response in the comments, or contact me. And feel free to make your own and let everyone know what and where it is!  Update: Sepoy at Chapati Mystery has created a desktop, and we created a Flickr pool, so if you make one and have a Flickr account, please add it to the pool!
