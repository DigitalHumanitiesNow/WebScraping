It’s time. I’ve decided to move from my “hub and spokes” model of diverse locales for diverse conversations and projects to start centralizing a few projects — which means I’m moving the blog over to my main site, susanfernsebner.org. This site will remain as its own archive, but I won’t be posting here, so it’ll just be a quiet repository (and you can find the same back-posts moved over, with comments, at the new blog-thread locale.) I like this page, but it’s also time for something a bit closer to home, more seamless, and also mobile-friendly… For the dedicated few still using their readers (and we know who we are), please update your feeds. Cheers.
