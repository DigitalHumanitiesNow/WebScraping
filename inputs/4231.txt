The International Institute for Asian Studies has just this week published my review of Ranjan Ghosh's A Lover's Quarrel with the Past: Romance, Representation, Reading. It is an intriguing, provocative and sometimes irritating work, written in dissent and flavoured with indignation, analyzing how myth-makers have come to dominate Hindu collective memory.Â You can read my review right here.I hope you enjoy it.
