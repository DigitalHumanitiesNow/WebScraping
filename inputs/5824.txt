1. Â Refuse requests for “to spec” writing. Â I did five essays like that in 2012 and while each one was a pleasant diversion from my main research agenda, the sum total–alongside grant applications–have taken me too far from the work sitting on my hard drive waiting to get out. Â I won’t declare bankruptcy on existing obligations but won’t add to them for awhile. Â If a request for a project comes in and there happens to be something cooking on my hard drive that’s a match, then we’re golden. 2. Â In the first instance, use the space opened up by these refusals to get my own new stuff out as I’ve been meaning to. Â I’ve got a series of signal processing pieces that need to be finished shown into the daylight. Â I’ve also got a stack of research on impairment phenomenology waiting to be read and written up. Â I’ve put in a massive grant application for a project on instrumentality. 3. Read more finished books that aren’t directly related to a paper I’m writing or a class I’m teaching. Â This category excludes books that are under review or come to me as part of tenure and promotion dossiers. Â Too much of my current reading is instrumental in nature. Â Articles are good too but I’m better about that in general. 4. Spend more time talking about people with that stuff, enjoying colleagues around town, students, etc. 5. Â Write more for nonacademic publications, other’s people’s blogs, op-eds, etc. 6. Â Continue to travel for presentationsÂ a little less. Â Avoid heroic travel at all costs.
