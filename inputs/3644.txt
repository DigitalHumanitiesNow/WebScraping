   I’ve just learned about a great timeline creation tool calledÂ Timeline.js. It is a very easy tool to create nice looking and very functional timelines.

I’ve created a very quick and rough timeline of the global tallow supply below. I will fix it up over the next few hours. I think this could be a great tool for undergraduate teaching.Â Here is what the Google spreadsheet looks like:
