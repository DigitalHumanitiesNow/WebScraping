Well, that was fun.  As predicted in October, the voice lift I had was temporary, and it’s pretty much gone now as far as I can tell.  I’ve noticed it in my voice, which has lost strength, low end and is more hoarse (the guy at our local fruiterie asked if I had a cold as I was checking out the broccoli and mozzarella last night).  More like what it was in the early fall.  But the place I really notice–and miss–is swallowing.  After paralysis, I relearned to swallow.  Then I relearned again after the voice lift but it was much easier.  Now I am relearning my original relearning.  Especially not fun with pills and, oddly, long pasta noodles. I phoned ENT at the General yesterday for my next one.  I don’t have a date yet, but this time, I will be ready.
