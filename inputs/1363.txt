First it was James and his blog. Then it was Orals Fixation. Now Sheila Brennan is blogging under a subdomain of ClioWeb. Sheila is also a PhD student in history at GMU, and she's working on "material culture, memory, and history museums" over the summer.  <img class="http://sheila.clioweb.org" src="">  It's awesome to be sharing some server space with some really bright people. Hopefully their blogging will nudge me into writing a little more. In any case, jump over to their blogs if you get tired of seeing the colors on this site changing every five minutes.
