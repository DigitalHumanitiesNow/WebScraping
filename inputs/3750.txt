It’s been four and a half years since I blogged the original Moodle Tool Guide. The guide has long since gone its own way. It doesn’t belong to me anymore, it belongs to the Moodle community. But I still enjoy seeing how the guide continues to find new audiences, communities and applications. This week I received a very nice tweet from Paolo Porcaro who has created perhaps the most romantic version yet, an Italian Moodle Tool Guide!  @catspyjamasnz Hello, I translated in Italian your Moodle Tool Guide for Teachers (v. 1.x) and I’d like to send you a copy. tx â Paolo Porcaro (@pporcaro) December 3, 2013 All of our generous MTG translators will have encountered the difficulties combination of not only translating technical and pedagogical terms but then making them fit a certain layout. In his email Paolo mentions the struggles of writing short enough Italian phrases to fit the matrix structure. Paolo did this translation while working for FormezPA, an Italian public administration agency who release all of their own publications under a CC-BY-SA license. So here it is. If you don’t speak Italian, you may want to put it on your pinboard anyway as an inspiration for 2014: you can learn a little Italian and be connected to the worldwide Moodle community!Â Mille grazie Paolo!

If I’m missing one, please let me know!
