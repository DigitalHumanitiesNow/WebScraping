 Â On the Japanese version ofÂ RinguÂ andÂ why she's having so much fun up there. Sample:  The most interesting visual element in this shot is the perspective implied by the camera placement. By partially obscuring the view of Reiko Asakawa, Nakata suggests that this might be a point-of-view shot, therebyÂ planting in the minds of the audienceÂ the idea that perhaps sheâs being watchedâand that the audience might be sharing the perspective of whoever (or whatever) is doing the watching. The fact that the camera is perfectly still here adds to the unease, because that lack of movement alone suggests the watcher may (or may not) be in plain sight, yet is undetected and wishes to remain so. In classic horror fashion, Nakata wants his audience to inhabit the mind and perspective of a stalker. And you know what? Being a stalker isÂ dull...  Â
