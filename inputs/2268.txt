At RSA 2012, I heard a lot of people using the words “materiality” and “ontology.” This is a good development in my view, but I was curious about the frequency of those terms in the conference schedule (the titles of papers and panels). Turns out, I might have self-selected my conversations a bit more than I realized. However, I should note that philosophers like Deleuze and Derrida were likely in the broader conversation more than is reflected in these graphs. Also, it seems a significant portion of the conversation around Burke was about re-writing him.
