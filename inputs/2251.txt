 Happy to say that I successfully defended my Ph.D. thesis today.Successfully defended: Twitter messages from my institute “Congratulations to Dr @jschneider who successfully defended her PhD at @insight_centre @deri @nuigalway today!” As for that “at @insight_centre @deri @nuigalway” bit? Our Galway-based research institute is in the course of changing names. DERI, the Digital Enterprise Research Institute, remains a part of the National University of Ireland, and under a new Irish national funding scheme, becomes INSIGHT Centre – Galway.
