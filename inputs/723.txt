For three of the past four years (2011, 2013, 2014), I have posted one picture each day of something beautiful I encounter. The impetus behind the project was to cultivate an attentiveness to the beauty of quotidian life. By integrating habits of mindfulness into my everyday routine, I have come to see the world differently. AlthoughÂ I will leave off thatÂ daily practice of picture taking in 2015, I will continue to take and post pictures over the course of the year with an eyeÂ nowÂ more attuned to the beauty we encounter all around us everyday. Here are twelve images from my 365 in 2014 project, one for each month.
