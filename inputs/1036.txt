The Old, Weird America -- As good a teaser as anyone can write, Rob MacDougall's recent post outlines his plans to embark on "some expeditions into the old, weird America." On why he hadn't started earlier: "I think I was worried how the word Ã¢â¬ÅweirdÃ¢â¬Â might look to a skittish job search committee. Score 1/2 for the Tribbles of the world. But now IÃ¢â¬â¢m kicking myself, as I think the old, weird America--the idea and the phrase itself--is on the verge of having an Elvis moment." Go, Rob, go. Looking forward to it!
