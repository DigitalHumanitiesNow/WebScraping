New Year’s eve Shmew Years eve… Between today and the beginning of theÂ new online classÂ on January 5th I have 1Â proposal due, 1Â talk to give, 60 conference panels to review, andÂ 2Â cross-continental flights. I can be forgiven for not thinking very much about the menu tomorrow evening… That being said, Digital Zombies is ready for deployment and 103 students have signed up. Cowabunga!!!
