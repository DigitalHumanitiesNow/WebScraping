Classicists usually refer to primary sources by means of abbreviated references,          called canonical references. Explicit linking of primary and secondary sources contained in the Digital Library         implies being able to automatically interpret and extract such references, which is still an open issue. A tool         currently under development for the automatic extraction of canonical references will be presented.
