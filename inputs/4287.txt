Very grateful for and overwhelmed by the totally unexpected notice on Slate.com today, and particularly for the many excellent comments, tweets, email messages, shares and new Followers this bit of press has garnered for MGB. I know it will take a few days for me to get back to everyone who asked a question or suggested a resource, but I hope to do it soon. So if youâ€™re coming for the first time, thanks very much!
