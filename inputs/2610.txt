This summer, NPR compiled a reader list of the “best-ever” young adult fiction–and faced a blizzard of criticism that the list was too white.Â  Salon summed up the controversy and analyzed the blame.Â  What do you think of this list and the way in which it was compiled?Â  How would you generate such a list?Â  And what are your personal favorites? BBC News commented on the not surprising (to me) idea that Roald Dahl’s books for kids can be awfully bleak.Â  What did surprise me is the outrage in the comments.Â  Many readers clearly thought this was an insult, and did not want a cherished author slighted, or their (faulty?) memories of his work compromised.Â  Are you a Dahl fan? Does this article bother you?Â  What do you make of the readers’ responses? I’m not especially a Harry Potter fan (not a hater, either), so I haven’t read much on J. K. Rowling.Â  Therefore, I learned a lot about her interesting background and the difficulties she had adapting to her life among the (g)literati in this article from The Guardian.Â  The big news is that she’s about to publish a novel for adults–and it’s not even fantasy.Â  The Casual Vacancy, which satirizes small town politics and the English class system, will be available September 27.Â  I have to admit that I have a kindle copy pre-ordered.Â  Are you ready for an adult novel from the person responsible for the Potter craze?
