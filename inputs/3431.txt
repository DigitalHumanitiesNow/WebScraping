Because tomorrow is Christmas Day, why don’t you get in the festive mood (though you just missed out on Festivus–sorry) and listen to this cover we recorded quickly and with little regard for quality. All we were shooting for was festive glory and merriment. As the title suggests, we really do wish it were Christmas today but I suppose I can wait a few more hours. Check out JKITT on bandcamp.
