After a few hours wrangling with Wordpress, Register.com, and my own web host, Reaching Readers is online and ready for consumption.   Jill still needs to write an "About Me" page, but she does have a "Favorite Books" page that I think will be updated every now and then. The pages feature in Wordpress is pretty cool...I hadn't played with it until I made Jill's blog. The blog itself will, I think, chronicle her thoughts as she reads all the Newberry Medal-winning books. If you have any thoughts or expertise on the subject, you should either drop a comment here at ClioWeb or stop by her blog and leave a comment. You can also email Jill at jillboggs AT gmail DOT com, changing the AT and DOT to "@" and "." respectively.
