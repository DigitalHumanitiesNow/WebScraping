It’s here! The first (free) chapter from my upcoming book,Â Engaging Students through Social Media: Evidence-Based Practices for Use in Student Affairs. The chapter covers how youth’s interactions online help them develop their identity, or a stable sense of self. Download the chapter here. The Kindle version of the entire book is now available on Amazon.com, hardcover will be released on August 18th. I look forward to hearing your thoughts about this chapter (which happens to be my favorite) and the rest of the book.Â
