I'm looking to annotate a PDF (or, if that's not possible, a stylized text file) with words and images, and present it online. I've looked into five programs--A.nnotate, Annotator, HyperStudio, Hypothes.is, and Pliny--and none allows users to share the results of their annotating publicly (whether via Word Press or a handmade site). Is anyone familiar with such a tool? I'm happy to research any leads. Regards, Tayt
