That's so much better than Vincente Fox. # Despite what I said in my #mla09 paper, I assign lotsof things that aren't papers. Which means I'm *always* #grading. # @amandalicastro I'm lucky enough to have insurance in my current gig. But I've been told I'm the only lecturer/VAP out of 30 that has it. in reply to amandalicastro # @GeorgeOnline And I'd rather have a bound thing than a shelf of loose printed PDFs. But I'm a bibliophile. Can you survey your students? in reply to GeorgeOnline # @GeorgeOnline But what's the total cost of PDFs? And what's the cost of used Nortons? in reply to GeorgeOnline # @GeorgeOnline You mean it's going to write grant proposals for me?! in reply to GeorgeOnline # @GeorgeOnline I wouldn't want to read things off a screen. I'd rather pay the $20 for a Norton. Or the $5 for a Dover. in reply to GeorgeOnline # One problem of adjuncting is that I don't have time to apply to the things that helps one move out of adjuncting. #downwardspiral #jobmarket # @billiehara I'm surprised you saw that since I'll *never* unfollow you!!! #stalker in reply to billiehara # @HannahRabon That was a quick turn-around. in reply to HannahRabon # @billiehara @billiehara You mean you're unfollowing people that are aren't unfollowing you? in reply to billiehara # More #grading accomplished.

Sigh # @buzzdad No. It's not. in reply to buzzdad # @cscannella Also good. Am fan of Ambling Alp too. I think Mondegreen is a full-on Boingo song. in reply to cscannella # @jbj Bitch. in reply to jbj # @jbj It's just the first track of the debut. The circus stuff? Intentionally awful. The rest of the album is solid gold. in reply to jbj # The new mp3 of the week is up.

Really helped me. # @mirk79 I'm also trying very hard to cut down paper feedback. I now use a timer any time that I'm #grading. in reply to mirk79 # @mirk79 Overprepping is 5 hours prep for a 75-minute class. I tend to want to know *exactly* what I want to accomplish. Even for discussion. in reply to mirk79 # @mattthomas Amen. in reply to mattthomas # @erinsells TTIUWOP in reply to erinsells # So I still over do it on #classprep.

What's the text on it? in reply to johnmjones # @tcarmody Google #Buzz. in reply to tcarmody # Discovering that most of my #eng465 students want to write about Hacker and the Ants. Last time I taught the course, everyone picked Lot 49. # @eetempleton Yes, in those instances they are. But I'm not dealing with comp class now. Sorry for the confusion. in reply to eetempleton # In comp classes, I should mention, I tell students to write an argument that we HAVE discussed in class. Don't worry @ content, just form. # Question: what do you do when students' proposed paper topics are more or less what you already discussed in class? # @billiehara @jbj @georgeonline Do you know how @drnels is feeling these days? in reply to drnels # I was observed teaching yesterday.Observer said nothing when leaving (fine since I was talking w/students), but I still have no email. #lame # @HannahRabon Consider them crossed. in reply to HannahRabon # @billiehara @academicdave I tend to talk about branding issues when a lot of students are wearing Coach or Burberry rain boots. in reply to billiehara # @academicdave Grand Theft Auto? in reply to academicdave # RT @amazonmp3: 2/17 Daily Deal: Matt & Kim's Grand, sugg'd if you like Mates of State or Passion Pit. $1.99 today: http://bit.ly/aDL8LT # @ktcrow Complete article, as long as it meets the job requirements/focus. in reply to ktcrow # I never have time for email on teaching days, which means that the non-teaching days are full of it. # Is it just me or is the @chronicle ghoulishly milking the U of Alabama shootings? # @eetempleton I think you mean it's been an especially *brutal* three decades. in reply to eetempleton # RT @ProfHacker: New at ProfHacker: @billiehara asks "What's for lunch?" and answers "Cafeteria Food!" http://bit.ly/a4gVCB # @mkgold That is an AMAZING syllabus.

Admittedly, it was the end of Lot 49, so it was a hard class. in reply to amandafrench # @filmsnob That's an essay I *have* to get the citation for. in reply to filmsnob # @joshbrez No. I believe they rejected me (along w/250 others). And the Chair decided to let me know s/he is aware of me & paper. Courtesy. in reply to joshbrez # @ryancordell I think they did. And to be honest, it worked. Nice to know that someone REAL (not mail merge) composed part of it. in reply to ryancordell # @katrinagulliver It's something to consider. May be inadvisable. But at this point in my #jobmarket search I can't not do it. in reply to katrinagulliver # @katrinagulliver Said that they read it with interest and sympathy.
