The Whitman Archive has been awarded a $275,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to create item-level finding guides to the nearly seventy individual repositories holding Whitmanâs prose manuscripts. The finding guides will attach to each description high-quality digital images for all the prose manuscripts. When coupled with the Whitman Archive’s similarly organized and award-winning guides to Whitman’s poetry manuscripts, this project will provide unprecedented documentation of and access to the literary manuscripts of a major literary figure.
