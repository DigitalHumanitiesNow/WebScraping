For the last (almost) year, I’ve been working with the OpenEducation Challenge on a new model of educational innovation in Europe.  The Open Education Challenge, launched in partnership with the European Commission, is part of Startup Europe. It is an opportunity for cutting-edge education startups to receive mentoring and seed funding through the European Incubator for Innovation in Education, and get direct access to investors from day one.  Although the challenge is privately funded, and the investors want to see financial sustainability and eventually expect a return on their investment – our primary concern is the educational excellence of our projects and the added value they bring to the European educational eco-system. To that effect, we have designed a blended incubation programme which aims to support the teams in developing their offering and achieving the best possible standards on four dimensions: educational value, business viability, technological implementation and presentation of their ideas.  We have recently completed the inaugural residential session of this programme, at Aalto University’s Design Factory. This was in itself an innovative educational experience, and I believe a very successful one – but you can judge for yourself from the account on our blog.  The teams are working hard on the tasks they defined for themselves in Helsinki, while we’re moving with the preparations for our next residential in Paris. We invite you to engage with us there – either as mentors for a day, or as guests at our showcase event.  Please get in touch with myself or with Montse Delgago, the OEC manager, if you want to get involved, or if you have any questions or comments.
