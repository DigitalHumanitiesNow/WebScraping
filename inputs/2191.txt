General Background and Biography David Hume was one of the most significant philosophers of the eighteenth century, and scores of book and articles have been written about him and his work.Â  It is easy to get overwhelmed if you try to do some background research on him.Â  So, here are a few sources that will help you situate David Hume in context as well as help you understand what he was trying to do in his Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion.  To get started, itâs good to read a bit about his life.Â  TheÂ Oxford Dictionary of NationalÂ  BiographyÂ is good for a short introduction.Â  Unfortunately, you must have a subscription to use the database.Â  For those who might have a strong background in philosophy, you mightÂ find the entry for Hume in theÂ Stanford Encyclopedia of PhilosophyÂ useful.Â  However, this resource is more helpful to those who have read some of Humeâs work and wish to have some of its arguments contextualized.Â  The same is true for theÂ Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. I would recommend starting with the podcast,Â In Our Time With Melvyn Bragg, âDavid Humeâ.Â  According to the BBC, Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the work of the philosopher David Hume. A key figure in the Scottish Enlightenment of the eighteenth century, Hume was an empiricist who believed that humans can only have knowledge of things they have themselves experienced. Hume made a number of significant contributions to philosophy. He saw human nature as a manifestation of the natural world, rather than something above and beyond it. He gave a sceptical account of religion, which caused many to suspect him of atheism. He was also the author of a bestselling History of England. His works, beginning in 1740 with A Treatise of Human Nature, have influenced thinkers from Adam Smith to Immanuel Kant and Charles Darwin, and today he is regarded by some scholars as the most important philosopher ever to write in English.
