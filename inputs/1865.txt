This Digital Campus episode was recorded live by Chris PreperatoÂ during Friday’sÂ second afternoon session of the RRCHNM’sÂ 20th Anniversary Conference and was produced by Anne Ladyem McDivitt and Alyssa Toby Fahringer. Mills Kelly, Stephen Robertson, and Tom Scheinfeldt joined host Dan Cohen to recap the earlier sessions of the day, including discussions on failure, ECHO, History Makers, pedagogy, and digital humanities centers’ websites.
