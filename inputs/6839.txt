Sara Thomas, Wikimedian in Residence at Museums Galleries Scotland This post was written by Sara Thomas, Wikimedian in Residence at Museums Galleries Scotland As I write this, I’m sitting in the library of the Glasgow Museum of Modern Art. Thereâs aÂ pleasing amount of public wifi, and an excellent cup of tea. This week Iâve also been inÂ Kelvingrove Museum, telling the Curatorial Forum more about what this Residency will involve,Â and in the Glasgow Museums Resource Centre, meeting more people and getting a tantalisingÂ peek inside the stores. Itâs only week two, but I’m really enjoying this job so far. This is the second residency in Scotland, with the first in the expert hands of Ally Crockford.Â Mine is a year-long project with Museums Galleries Scotland, the first four months of which willÂ be spent on secondment to Glasgow Museums. Itâs very much a networked residency (notÂ unlike Pat Hadleyâs with the Yorkshire Network Project) and will see me working with multipleÂ institutions across Scotland. I am more than excited. Iâve lived in Glasgow since the late nineties, and so itâs with great pleasure that I get theÂ opportunity to talk open knowledge in some of the institutions in which Iâve spent so much timeÂ over the years, particularly Kelvingrove Museum. Iâm also delighted to be able to investigate theÂ collections surrounding the Kelvin Hall project, which is currently under development, and seeÂ how we might use them to enrich the encyclopedia. Even though itâs only week two, a goodÂ many leads have already presented themselves, and Iâm hopeful that my residency will be ableÂ to kick start a longer term relationship between these institutions and Wikimedia. Iâll let youÂ know how I get on…
