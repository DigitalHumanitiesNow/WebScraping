Dr. Daniel Heidt gave a presentation titled, âData Overload? Software Solutions for Academic Researchers.â In that presentation, Dr. Heidt reviewed many of the challenges of managing digitized archival sources and he demonstrated a number of different pieces of software that can help sort and analyze our ever-increasing piles of digital data.
