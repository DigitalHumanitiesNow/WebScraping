This picture is below the line, since it’s my trache (outside of me).  Looking at it now, it’s hard to believe the thing was inside of me.  This was the smaller size of the two I’d had in.  I could talk, eat and swallow with this one and sort of breathe around it when it was taped.  It’s amazing how fast I was able to get used to these things, though it’s also amazing how uncomfortable it looks just sitting there.  I guess there’s something in that about the resiliency of the human body, or our ability to adjust.
