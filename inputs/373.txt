HyperCities is a Digital Humanities project which aims to be a database of places that exist in four coordinates, the fourth coordinate being that of time. At its core, itâs a digital mapping project, but it has developed with the times. Nowadays, itâs a fully participatory platform which can contain all kinds of geo-temporal data. Itâs also fully accessible and relies on the collaboration of a variety of users in order to thrive.Although it makes use of Google Maps and Google Tools, HyperCities has a set of integrated features which allows the users to âtravel through timeâ. This is achieved through the use of historical maps, available in those cities which have a team behind concentrating on them. These maps can be layered on top of satellite views of contemporary cities. This is a fantastic feature for educational purposes, as it makes for a good visualization of historical events and places. You can also explore the collections curated by scholars and regular users alike. The ânarrative modeâ can be used with these collections. The narrative mode allows users to follow the events on the map while also exploring different kinds of related media on a sidebar.Â The potential of HyperCities, at least in theory,Â goes as far as the user’s imagination.
