 AndrÃ© Luiz Mesquitaâs dissertation (in Portuguese),Â Mapas Dissidentes: ProposiÃ§Ãµes Sobre um Mundo em Crise (1960-2010),Â (Dissenting Maps: Propositions on a World in Crisis, 1960-2010),Â looks at the maps and diagrams of artists and activists from 1960 to 2010, all working in social, political, and economic contexts of crisis and change, conflict and various forms of resistance. He approaches the work of three generations of artists through an analysis of endless documents, catalogs, manifestos, articles, photographs, documentaries, art works, reproductions of maps, and interviews. Mesquita beginsÂ by examining the games and maps created in the 1960s and â70s by the Swedish-Brazilian artist, Ãyvind FahlstrÃ¶m (1928-1976), made under the geopolitical tensions of the Cold War (1947-1991) and the structural and organizational changes in global capitalism of the 1970s.  Ãyvind FahlstrÃ¶m’s World Map He then turns to the work of the American artist, Mark Lombardi (1951-2000), who, in the 1990s, mapped international power networks and obscure financial transactions involving banks, governments, and neoliberal elites.  Mark Lombard’s World Finance Finally Mesquita addresses the counter-cartography practices developed betweenÂ the 1990s and 2010âs by three activist art collectives: Bureau dâÃtudes (France), the Counter-Cartographies Collective (United States), and Iconoclasistas (Argentina). Based on the interrelations between contemporary art, political activism, and critical cartography, Mesquita holds that the work of these activists-artists has created a significant opposition to the âneutral and objectiveâ maps made in the interests of corporate, governmental, and military bodies.  Bureau de’Etudes’s Refuse the Biopolice â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢  Counter-Cartographies Collective’s DisOrientation Guide â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢  Iconoclasistas’ RadiografÃ­a del CorazÃ³n del Modelo Sojero Whatâs really exciting is the mining Mesquita has done, coming up with a range of map work that will surprise the causal observer of, say,Â FahlstrÃ¶m (in particular); but also the way he attaches all this work to that of antecedents (like the Surrealists and the Situationists) and parallels (as in the work of Trevor Paglen).
