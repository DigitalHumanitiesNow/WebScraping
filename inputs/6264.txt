It’s interesting to compare New Aesthetic street art to Swiss artist Felice Variniâs work.   (Via Street Art News.)  He makes gigantic installations by projecting abstract 2D shapes onto 3D physical spaces, then manifesting the projected images as physical overlays, turning slide images into physical objects. Variniâs work is clearly in the long traditions of trompe-lâoeil and anamorphosis in art. Today, it’s a useful reminder that some New Aesthetic objects, some examples of augmented reality, and in general artistic representations of the eversion of cyberspace, are also part of the longer tradition of optical illusion and experiments with perception in art, in particular, explorations of 2D/3D dimensional slippage. The difference is the thematic focus the digital “dimension.”
