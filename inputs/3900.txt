Last spring, I spent a month in the Manuscripts and Archives Division ofÂ the New York Public Library, conducting research for my food book. I recently wrote a blog post about that experience– and the experience, more generally, of conducing archival research. It’sÂ now been posted on the NYPL blog, andÂ you can read it here.
