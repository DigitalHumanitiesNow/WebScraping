The results of the first THATCamp Council election are in, and no runoff election will be necessary. Thanks to the 89 people who voted. Here are the four who will be joining me, Tom Scheinfeldt, and Patrick Murray-John on the first THATCamp Council:Anastasia SalterJeff McClurkenFrÃ©dÃ©ric ClavertMicah VandegriftI can’t tell you how grateful I am to all who ran: we all know that this kind of service is driven much more by conviction than by systemic reward. All the candidates are people I’d be proud to work with.As Chair pro tem until we appoint an official Chair, I’ll be arranging the first meeting (to be held sometime in April, most likely) and drafting an agenda. The agenda will be posted here on the blog and will be open for comment.I’m still a fan of having fun and being productive in a informal and collegial gathering, even after all these years. Imagine that. Whatever happens next with THATCamp, that won’t change, I know. En avant!
