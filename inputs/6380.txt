We have uploaded another three volumes of the Journal of the House of Lords: volumes 21, 22, and 23, which cover the years 1718 to 1730. In partnership with The History of Parliament Trust we are able to digitise 19 volumes this summer, to add to the volumes already on BHO. We are particularly pleased that by digitising up to volume 39 we will be able to cover the eighteenth century up to 1790, so covering the American Revolution and the beginning of the French Revolution. We plan to add the remaining 16 volumes (24-39) to BHO over the next few months.
