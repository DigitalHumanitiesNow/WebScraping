My colleague, Jennifer Adams, and I, have written a short article, 'Digital Humanities: Where to start' for librarians interested in working in the digital humanities.Â  The article is published in College & Research Libraries News (October, 2012).Please send me your comments; constructive criticism is welcome too.
