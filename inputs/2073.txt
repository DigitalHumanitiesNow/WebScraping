The paper attempts a change of focus from the single project to a broader range of         e-publishing, considered by content and by target audience. The discussion covers both complex html-publications         and scholarly papers. Potential fragilities are noted in the infrastructures which support each type, and         consideration is given to current developments in archiving which aim to rectify them. A digital bibliography is         included in the presentation file.
