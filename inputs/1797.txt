It’s out, it’s out, it’s finally out! Â The book I wrote, together with some help from four wonderful colleagues – The People’s Guide to Spatial Thinking – was released yesterday by the National Council for Geographic Education. Â It’s a short “primer” on spatial thinking, designed to help you understand the what and why of this important topic. Â It’s a quick and entertaining read. Buy your copy today!
