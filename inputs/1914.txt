Today, Iâm blogging over here for the Day of dh 2010.  Hashtag for the affair is #dayofdh.  The Day of Digital Humanities is a virtual flash mob in which lots of digital humanists blog about their day.  We do it mainly to demonstrate to other scholarly communities that we have way more fun than they do.
