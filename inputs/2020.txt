What contribution can digital collections give to research in Ancient History? In order to answer this question, digital historians have rightly concentrated on the problem of how to structure the different documents (such as texts, surviving artifacts, geographical locations and related published works), so that the relevant materials can be retrieved with meaningful content-oriented queries. Among the projects that are pursuing this goal, the Hellespont Project (DAI, Perseus Project) focuses on the history of Athens in the years 479-431 BCE, as narrated in the text of Thucydides' Histories (I, 89-118). Yet, written sources for Ancient History (such as the works of Ancient historians) are especially complex. In order to get access to their content, they need structuring at a far more advanced level than current digital editions can provide. We propose to use the methods of current computational linguistics to address this issue. In particular we will explore how, in the Hellespont Project, we are taking advantage of the available annotated syntactic corpora and upgrading their model with supplementary annotation. Our goal is to enrich the text of Thucydides with with word-by-word linguistic annotation on morphology, syntax, valency frame and other discursive features such as semantic roles, verbal aspect, anaphora resolution and topic-focus articulation.
