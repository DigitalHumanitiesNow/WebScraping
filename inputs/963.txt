There are lots of articles online of the form -Â humanity has built some amazing things, so why haven't we produced an artificial intelligence? These articles (here's an example) often include some discussion of a task that even a very young human can perform - e.g. look at an image and describe what objects are in it (though personally I don't believe this is an indication of intelligence). I believe that one of the key reasons that we can produce algorithms that can design super efficient jet engines, but not systems with the rudimentary common sense reasoning capabilities of a 3 year old is the economic context that drives innovation. The airline industry has an annual revenue of 700 billion dollars. No one has (yet) articulated the revenue potential of a technology that can look at a photograph and tell you what is in it. The most important (and possibly last) step in the development of artificial intelligence is to create the economic engine that will require and motivate it.
