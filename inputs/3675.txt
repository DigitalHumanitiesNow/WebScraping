Since Jeff Sconce has abandoned the all important rodent news beat, it is my duty to alert you to this important and controversial rodent-related Wikipedia page.  I also really enjoy the deletion discussion.  The article is already sourced to the New York Times, Washington Post, Toronto Sun, and the St. Louis and Pittsburgh and Seattle and Detroit papers and so forth. I’m not clear what I’m suppose to wait for here… notices in Isvestia or the People’s Daily, maybe? The Lancet or Science or Foreign Affairs, I guess. As to getting notice from the President of the United States, that’s a pretty high barrier for a squirrel. He’s just a little squirrel, he’s not Ratatoskr. These are all pretty high barriers for any article, I think. I’ve written tons of articles on subjects that the President hasn’t weighed in on. Well, you have pretty high standards, which is OK.

There’s already a tie-in to Norse mythology which I think most baseball events don’t have. Here is an economic-impact analysis, although granted only peripherally about the Rally Squirrel per se. If we’re waiting for articles like “Rally Squirrel: Another Harbinger of the Decline of Western Civilization?” or “Rally Squirrel and the Inner Self: A Critical Response” or something, I suppose we’ll have a pretty long wait. It’s already pretty notable in St. Louis, which after all has more people (metro area) than Jamaica or Mongolia and more than half as many as Norway or Ireland. So, hmmm.
