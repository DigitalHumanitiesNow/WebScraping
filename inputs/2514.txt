Monday, Oct. 3, 2011, 4:30-6 pm370 Dwinelle HallUniversity of California, Berkeley An ongoing speaker and workshop series with events once per semester, “Computing and the Practice of History” will explore the possibilities and challenges that come with the use of digital technology in historical and other humanities research.  Our speakers will discuss how they use computing technology, and they will also be invited to address larger questions regarding the future of computing and humanities research.  They are selected to represent a variety of historical fields and a variety of technologies, so that our series might offer the broadest possible introduction to the ways that historians are using computing technology. The inaugural event will feature Timothy Hitchcock, Professor of History at the University of Hertfordshire, and Director of the Old Bailey Online and of London Lives. Sponsored by the Department of History at the University of California, Berkeley, with support from the Mellon Foundation.
