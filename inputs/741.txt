To honor the work of Richard Bernstein and specifically his influence as a teacher at the New School for Social Research, Marcia Morgan and Jonathan Pickle invited a group of his former students to write essays for a volume entitled Thinking the Plural: Richard J. Bernstein’s Contributions to American Philosophy. My contribution has the working title: The Ethics of Philosophy in a Digital Age: Peirce, Dewey, Bernstein and the Cultivation of Creative Digital Democracies. Drawing on Bernstein’s account of the ethos of pragmatism in his 1988 Presidential Address to the American Philosophical Association, the essay advocates for practices of digital communicative transaction rooted in the habits of an “engaged fallibilistic pluralism.” Because one of the hallmarks of this approach is that it not only advocate in word, but practice in deed the ethics of philosophy it seeks to embody, I am posting a draft of the essay here for public comment. The slideshare of my presentation is available here:  The paper is made available as a Google document with open permissions for anyone to comment and embedded here to easy access and viewing. Of course, I welcome comments here on the blog as well, or via Twitter or Facebook as well.
