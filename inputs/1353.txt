I'm embarassed that I'm just now getting around to reading it (sorry Sharon!), but so far it's awesome. Go take a look, if you haven't already. I'm just getting around to reading it this morning, but it looks impressive. Here are a few of my favorite quotes from the latest carnival.  "God, I love archival research. You could never make up the stuff you actually find." -- Eric Muller.  "If Gen. [X] finds anybody selling mischievous matters within the sphere of his authority, he might give him a good thrashing or put him in the stocks, but he cannot reach the editors who make money in New York, or Chicago, or Louisville by pandering to the taste of certain cliques." -- William T. Sherman, in a letter transcribed by Pipsqueak.  "Graduate and student, advisor and advisee, tenured faculty and adjunct, administrator and staff, in a word, professor and professed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of the university at large, or in the cancellation of the offending classes." -- Eb at No Great Matter rewrites the Communist Manifesto for today's university.  And everyone should congratulate Sheila for getting mentioned on the carnival for her post on History Museums on the Web.
