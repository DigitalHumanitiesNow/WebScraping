 The following is a guest post from MLA Executive Director, Rosemary Feal. Rosemary asked on Twitter yesterday if anyone would be willing to post a short guest post from her on his or her blog. I volunteered, and the rest is history. If you want to play along, you can find the 2011 MLA Convention program here [PDF].Â –BC Itâs easy to cherry-pick 13 sessions for the purpose of finding plays on words, references to popular culture, use of specialized vocabulary, or titles that, well, just sound alien. Or are about aliens. Zombies, even. What would happen if I picked 13 sessions entirely at random, I wondered? So I went to random.org and asked it to choose 13 numbers between 1 and 821 (821 was the last session number on the MLA convention program). Hereâs what it came up with.
