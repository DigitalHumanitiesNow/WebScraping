In response to my last post on âthe Stream,â Cameron Blevins (History-ing.org) pointed out that one âissue with the stream is the seemÂ­ingly eterÂ­nal one of breadth vs. depth,â and that one of the âbiggestâ chalÂ­lenges for a user was the âtransiÂ­tion from horiÂ­zontal skimÂ­ming to verÂ­tical borÂ­ing downâ into the stream. I agree with Cameron that transitioning from one level to the other is a fundamental skill and a challenge to learn and practice. I do, however, believe that these are skill sets humanists already use/practice to a greater (or lesser) extent. I had to develop both skills, especially the skimming technique, for history grad seminars: 1 monograph (+ any needed supplementary material) / class / week @ 2 â 3 classes / semester. In fact, I am still developing these skills as I prep for quals this spring. The deep drilling is, I would agree, the hardest to negotiate. The question, at least for me, is how digital tools may help us with deep boring the ever-thickening data streamâparticularly with respect to the point Dr. Cohen made in âInterchange: The Promise of Digital HistoryâÂ  about research and drilling deep in a research project. What the tools are/is/will be is an open question, at least for me. I think that the API Workshop hosted by NiCHE looks very promising in helping the digital humanist find and/or create such tools: Historians and other humanists now have access to digital primary and secondary sources on an unprecedented scale, but almost all of these resources are delivered through web browsers with the assumption that a person will be plodding through them one at a time. What we need now are ways to make these sources readily available to computer programs: intelligent agents, machine learners, adaptive filters, data mining packages, you name it. We need to be able to recombine information from multiple sources in a way that supports the discovery of new information. And we need to provide tools that allow networked collectives to work together and leverage the power and diversity of the individuals that comprise the group. â William Turkel  Our ability to tap the stream, whether on a horizontal or vertical level, as Cameron noted, is the one area âthat has the greatÂ­est potenÂ­tial for real advanceÂ­ment, especially in the digÂ­iÂ­tal humanÂ­iÂ­ties.â Our skim v. bore skill set honed in seminars, quals, and research in general gives us (I think) a unique perspective in developing or realigning existing digital tools to address this issue. What are your thoughts on this issue? What other issues exist for the humanist with respect to the real-time stream? What are the tools that exist or should exist forÂ  deep boring this stream?
