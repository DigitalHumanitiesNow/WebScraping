 	There is still time to sign up for Zotero Trainer Workshops this November:November 8-9, 2012 Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MANovember 15-16, 2012 University of Colorado, Boulder, CONovember 29-30, 2012 University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MIThe first of this year’s workshops was held at Georgia State University in Atlanta, GA. Participants came from different backgrounds and arrived with wide range of prior experience with Zotero – from virtual novice to seasoned expert – but all left with wealth of new skills and information."The workshop was exceedingly useful because it covered Zotero basics for the novice, but [also] gave librarians and other trainers the inside scoop on the way that Zotero works (...). Getting the hands on practice writing a citation style and a translator also drove home the fact that it is not too daunting a task for non-developers."—Hannah Rogers, Public Services Librarian, Mercer University 	Though I’ve used and taught Zotero for several years now, Sebastian’s workshop taught me many new tricks and techniques. It was an intensive look behind the scenes from an expert who really understands Zotero in and out, and helped me reach a deeper understanding of this fantastic software.—Jason Puckett, Communication Librarian, Georgia State University, author of Zotero: A Guide for Librarians, Researchers, and Educators 	After gaining an in-depth understanding of Zotero’s functionality, participants discussed and shared strategies for supporting and documenting Zotero. The last session of each day was dedicated to going beyond using Zotero towards extending it. Participants learned that one need not be a "coder" to adapt a citation style or even write a simple translator for Zotero – the results of those sessions, a new citation style for the journal Conservation Letters and a translator for the Atlanta Journal Constitution website are now part of Zotero. The agenda of the Atlanta workshop is available online. 	The cost for the workshops is $350 per participant.
