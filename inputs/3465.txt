Visits [v.isits.in] automatically visualizes personal location histories, trips and travels by aggregating geotagged one's Flickr collection with a Google Maps history. developed by Alice Thudt, Dominkus Baur and prof. Sheelagh Carpendale, the map runs locally in the browser, so no sensitive data is uploaded to external servers.  The timeline visualization goes beyond the classical pin representation, which tend to overlap and are relatively hard to read. Instead, the data is shown as 'map-timelines', a combination of maps with a timeline that convey location histories as sequences of maps: the bigger the map, the longer the stay. This way, the temporal sequence is clear, as the trip starts with the map on the left and continues towards the right.   A place slider allows the adjusting of the map granularity, reaching from street-level to country-level.  Read the academic research here [PDF], or watch a explanatory video below.
