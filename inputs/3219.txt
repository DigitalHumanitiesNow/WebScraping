In iBrain: Surviving the Technological Alteration of the Modern Mind, Gary Small writes, “The current explosion of digital technology not only is changing the way we live and communicate but is rapidly and profoundly altering our brains.  Daily exposure to high technology--computers, smart phones, video games, search engines like Google and Yahoo--stimulates brain cell alteration and neurotransmitter release, gradually strengthening new neural pathways in our brains while weakening old ones.  Because of the current technological revolution, our brains are evolving right now--at a speed like never before.”
