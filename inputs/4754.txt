  After the wildly successful 2013 edition of Across A Crowded Room,Â we are about to launch a second edition that is more exciting than ever before.  If you are a musical theater...  Â ...composer longing for lyrics,Â  	...lyricist looking for a composer, 	...bookwriter browsing for scores, 	...singer searching for new songs (or any combination of the above) then this is the event for you! Last year teams of complete strangers teamed up to write mini-musical theater scenes that they presented for Lisa Lambert,Â Thomas Meehan, and Joshua Schmidt. Â   This year, we will offer a full summer seminar on musical theater writing with seminarsÂ by masters of the artÂ including:  Lynn Ahrens on Lyrics: Saturday, June 13 from 10 am - 12 Noon  LisaÂ Kron on Bookwriting: Saturday,Â June 27 from 10 am - 12 Noon  Jason Robert Brown on Composition: Saturday,Â July 11Â from 10 am - 12 Noon  Participants will write a 20 minute musical that will be presented in the Bruno Walter auditorium at Lincoln Center on August 29 (yes, you can have a show presented at Lincoln Center!)Â   We will begin with a mixer on May 16 from 10 am - 12 noonÂ that will help you find the collaborators you need. Â   SIGN UP HERE TO PARTICIPATE  Please noteÂ that participants will be expected to attend all five events.Â You may also want to link to a sample of your work (on YouTube, Google Drive, SoundCloud, whatever) in the comments section below so that potential collaborators can be on the look out for you.  For inspiration, here are three of the songs performed at the 2013 event:  Should've Known Better (Music: Rachel Evans / Lyrics: David Brush / Vocals: Erin Martinez)   Girls My Age (Music By Jonathon Lynch, Lyrics by Nathan Brisby, Vocals by Stephanie Eve Parker)    The Game Must Change (Music and Vocals By Sidsel Ben Semmane, Lyrics by Nathan Brisby ad Sidsel Ben Semmane)
