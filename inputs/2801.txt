Digital privacy is a weird thing. People confuse it for digital security, but it's much more than that. Privacy isn't keeping secrets, it's controlling the information we share. What we think of as privacy depends on trusting that the people we share with won't do bad things. Privacy isn't digital at all. Maybe instead of "digital privacy" we should talk about "digital discretion".The recent revelations of how Adobe Digital Editions was spewing the users' reading activity, unencrypted, to a logging server are an instructive example of poor digital discretion. I thought that Adobe was working on an ebook synchronization system, but it now looks like ADE was doing the logging "to support new business models" rather than for ebook sync.  It got me thinking about how ebook synchronization can and should be done.Synchronization is a useful function. I'd like to be able to start reading a book on my iPhone while on the train in the morning, then pick up reading where I left off in the evening using my iPad. But to accomplish this function, I need to trust someone with information that discloses what I'm reading. It's easy to design a centralized sync system that requires a reader to register who they are,  what book they're reading and an activity stream of what pages are being read.But a sync system designed for privacy doesn't need all that information. The central server doesn't even need to know the identity of the book! As Jason Griffey pointed out in his article on Adobe's spyware, the book's identifier could be hashed with a password, effectively hiding its identity from the central server.I wrote about how Bluefire is doing sync for their apps while trying their best to respect user privacy. Rather than obscuring the identity of the book, they focus on making it hard to identify users in their system.Adobe was justifiably criticized for sending lots of information back to its central server without encryption. Although their version 4.0.1 sends less information, mostly Adobe is just encrypting the stream and claiming the privacy problem is solved. The core privacy problem remains- when a DRM ebook is read, an encrypted activity stream is sent back to Adobe. If the information is sensitive or useful, why should Adobe get the benefit of this information at all? At the very least, providing your activity stream to Adobe should be opt-in.There's a second privacy problem that hasn't been discussed anywhere. It may seem contradictory, but central-server synchronization systems impose TOO MUCH privacy. In many situations, a reader will want to share their reading stream. Look at GoodReads - you can share your opinions with friends. Look at Kobo Reading Life - you get awards and statistics in return for your stream. In classroom situations, students could sync their readers with the instructors'. These sorts of affordances can't be developed without access to the reading-activity stream, and won't work unless everyone participating in the stream is in the same reading ecosystem, using the same central server.If instead of encrypting the reading-event stream, encryption were applied to the events themselves, the events could be shared over most any messaging system, and distributed according to the user's choices and desired application. In fact, you could use Twitter.Every user of a Twitter-reading-sync system would create a Twitter feed to publish their reading activity. Other users could subscribe to the event stream. Direct messages could be used to send decryption data for private reading streams. The system could be engineered so that even Twitter would be unable to know what's being read privately. And the whole world would have access to reading that's being done publicly. In addition to page turning,  bookmarking and annotation activity could be of interest.It's interesting to think about what might happen in a reading ecosystem where readers, not corporations, control the access to their reading activity streams. Publishers and authors might provide incentives to readers who share their reading-events with them. Social networks might match users reading the same page of the same book. Libraries could learn how to meet the needs of their communities. Teachers might be alerted to passages that students find to be difficult. Ironically, these public uses are enabled by a system design which puts a premium on privacy for the reader. Dave Egger's novel "the Circle" gave us the expression "Privacy is Theft". The novel imagines a social norms that consider privacy to be a reflection of selfishness. But in the real world, it's the lack of discretion by companies building up vast private collections of personal information that's the true threat to social sharing. Too bad that theft is not a crime.
