Theorist Rosi Braidotti writes that âhabits are socially enforcedâ. Sometimes it is easy to see how a behaviour trend could serve a particular political purpose, as for example in the clichÃ©d lament that we are turned into passive subjects by habitual addiction to sitting in front of mindless television.  But what about habits which donât seem to serve any political, social or cultural purpose? What about biting our nails, scratching our bollocks, or splitting our ends?In these habits the subject derives a pleasure which has no âvalueâ to it and may even be to the detriment of it (it can be painful or even fatal, as the man who recently died from biting his nails found).  As Californian nu-metal band Linkin Park point out in âBreaking the Habit,â the habit is often seen a case of self-destruction; âI’m picking me apart againâ (a quote which seems strangely apt to this unfortunate nail biter).This pleasure involves repeating processes which have no âpurposeâ but which nevertheless produce a little bit of unnameable pleasure (what Jacques Lacan might call âjouissanceâ â a pleasure that has no use-value).  If these habits involve something like jouissance then they are not useful to society at all but are characterized by being without social purpose.Freud sees such habits as an example of our failure to adhere to societyâs expectations of us.  For Freud, nail biting is a symptom of oral fixation, a desire to replace childhood oral functions (such as the sucking of the motherâs breast) with other oral acts (such as biting the nails.)  This demonstrates the subjectâs failure to become an independent adult.  Strangely sharing something with this view, our general approach to such habits is that they are child-like (especially if one thinks of sucking oneâs thumb). Thus, the habit represents, in a strange way, the failure to grow up. It could even be seen as a rejection of societal expectations; refusing to give up a basic pleasure that is deemed socially unpalatable such as sucking your thumb or scratching your balls in public.On the other hand SÃ¸ren Kierkegaardâs novella Repetition defines ârepetitionâ in a way that reverses this idea of habit as the failure to adhere to societal expectations.  In that text, repetition exists as a way of constituting the stable identity of something through time; if we keep doing something it becomes part of who we are.  If we put our habits into these terms, what is different from Freud is that the habitual repetition is not the subversion of an otherwise organized and stable development of the subject but rather; repetitious habits are the normal way of the subject developing and constructing itself, repeating a behaviour pattern so that we can recognise continuity in ourselves. Â This is of course exactly what we are ‘supposed to do’ so that we make nice coherent subjects who don’t have too many inconsistencies and ambiguities and are easy to organise and regulate..In her fascinating study On Habit, Clare Carlisle writes; âwe say that someone acts out of habit, but does this âdispositionâ or âtendencyâ continue to exist when the habit is not being exercised?â  The key word when thinking about habits may be these two: disposition and tendency.  When we say that we act out of habit, we imply that there is something behind our actions, perhaps a âdispositionâ (a word which means both inclination and character â making a crucial link between the two) or maybe a âtendencyâ, a word that makes out that behaviours come from a natural impulse.  Bringing Kierkegaard back in to the discussion: what we want to do with our habit is construct a continuity of tendency â the idea that at some internal and even natural level we have an inclination towards acts which is our own tendency, a part of who we are, and which stays with us throughout our lives. Even these habits then, might be following social orders. Thus, the habit does have a purpose.  Far from being the indicator of an unbalanced subject, the habit is involved in the production of a balanced one; it makes it appear that beneath all the changes that occur to us is a continuity of subjectivity with tendencies true to its nature that are difficult to shift and control.  Being closely tied to our habits prevents us realising how unstable and changeable we actually are, giving us a comforting feeling that some of our desires have been our unchanged from childhood onwards, something Freud might have been guilty of himself .
