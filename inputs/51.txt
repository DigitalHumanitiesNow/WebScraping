Three Ontological Provocations    I was invited to give an Ignite presentation at SIGDOC 2013.  This was my first try at giving a presentation in this format, and I must say, it's much more enjoyable than the typical academic talk. All of the photos here are from my ongoing fieldwork exploring the geocaching community. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this talk!
