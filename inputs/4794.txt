officinak:  One Microsoft GiphoscopesWe have recently made 30 tailor made Giphoscopes for participants in One Microsoft: a 3 day presentation of the latest Microsoft devices in Rome.Each guest, at his arrival, was invited to record a videoclip of few seconds with the new smartphone Microsoft Lumia 640 XL.
