 There’s quite a bit already written about Las Vegas’ first inter-racial hotel and casino but this is such a singular site, with such a layered history, it deserves a post here. Plus, the visual materials–matchbooks, postcards, ads–are so good, it wouldn’t serve to leave them in my files where they couldn’t be seen. The Moulin Rouge is different from most of the sites in theÂ Mapping Green BookÂ project in a couple of significant ways. First, it was extremely well-known at the time of its opening on May 26, 1955. The hotels and casinos of Las Vegas were, up until that time, strictly segregated, which caused all kinds of hardships for the dozens of African American performers who were booked there. Las Vegas and Nevada had already established a harsh policy of spatial segregation, wage suppression, and terrible living conditions for African American workers, and though there were hotels that had tried to push back on these policies, at the time of the Moulin Rouge’s debut, none had yet succeeded. It’s splashy opening was made much of in local and regional newspapers, so it’s closing, only five months later, was pretty shocking.  The building complex itself if differs from manyÂ MGBÂ sites in that there is an architectural firm of record:Â Walter Zick and Harris Sharp, Architects. The firm is responsible for much of Las Vegas’ iconic mid-century architecture (there’s a link to their papers in the UNLVÂ librariesÂ in the sources below)Â and it suggests that the group of investors, including Louis Rubin, a Â restauranteur who owned Chandlers in New York, and LA developer Alexander Bisano, were going out big.Â   The building site, at 900 West Bonanza Road, is on the west side of Las Vegas, an area that had already been designated the black side of town, and thus received little or no city services well into the 20th century. It’s worth noting that the Moulin was built here, and not on the Vegas strip where the other casinos were. This may have been a way of skirting the formal and informal segregation laws of the city and state, which still barred African Americans from eating, gambling, and staying in hotels and casinos on the strip. On the west side, African Americans were already permitted to do these things–the shift was in allowing whites to join them. So we still essentially have a system where black people are not allowed in white spaces, but now white people are invited into black spaces. Inter-racial space, at this point, Â does not mean equity, or parity.  The Moulin Rouge’s second moment of significance is the role it played, as a venue, in changing this dynamic. In March of 1960, the NAACP held a meeting at the Moulin Rouge with local casino owners, businessmen, and politicians, and according to the National Register nomination form and other sources, this meeting effectively ended segregation on the strip. There’s clearly a longer, more complicated story there, but this moment at the Moulin Rouge complex (the original MR had closed back in 1955) adds another layer to the building’s history. According to Google maps, the building is still there, along a rather ragged stretch of road punctuated by abandoned-looking storage buildings and razor wire. Â The original building complex was concrete and stucco with a shingle roof, embellished with a fantastic neon sign blazing along street-facing side of the casino building. At the time of it’s National Register nomination in 1992, the interior decoration of the casino building, along with the theater and auditorium, were still intact, and were described asÂ "colorful murals depicting can-can dancers, fancy cars, and onlookers.âÂ Â The Moulin Rouge has suffered a number of uses, as well as a fire in 2003, but hopefully the sign, which survived the fire, is sequestered safely somewhere. The history of the Moulin Rouge is well documented.
