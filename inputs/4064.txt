This is an astounding interview of Garry Wills on the Colbert Report. On the one hand, professed-Catholic Wills denies the validity of transubstantiation (âitâs a fakeâ), last rites, the priesthood, and the papacy like a low-church Protestant. On the other hand, Wills bases some of his arguments on denying the usefulness of the book of Hebrews for theology like a â¦ well, not like a Catholic or most Protestant traditions. Itâs hard to figure out where Wills is coming from.
