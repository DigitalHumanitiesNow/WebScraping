We are pleased to announce the publication of the newest issue of Scholarly Editing: The Annual of the Association for Documentary Editing (vol. 35, 2014), online at www.scholarlyediting.org. Scholarly Editing publishes peer-reviewed editions of primary source materials of cultural significance while continuing the decades-long tradition of publishing articles and reviews about editing that defined its print predecessor, Documentary Editing. As always, the editions represent diverse materials from a variety of fields, and this year we also present our first non-English language edition. We are pleased not only to present editors with a rigorously peer-reviewed publication platform, but also to share fascinating documents from cultural history with the reading public. All of this material is available freely online and is completely open-access.
