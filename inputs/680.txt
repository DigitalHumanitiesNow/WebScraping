I've been favoriting and archiving some of the many interesting pictures that people have been posting to twitter, using the #infsum hastag, as part of the Infinite Summer project. I've been tinkering around, trying to automate the process using the twitter API in order to get a nice clean-looking aggregated output. But when I saw this tweet today, I thought I'd share some of what I've got so far.  Note: I have made the, I hope not irrational, assumption that people who posted these pictures to twitter would not mind having them aggregated here. These images remain the property of the individuals who originally posted them. If you find an images of yours here and would like it removed, just let me know (email me at cforster[at]virginia.edu). By the same token, if you've got an image that you think would fit here, let me know that as well.  I'll continue tinkering and update later.  (This first, big, one is my dog Rodney with Infinite Jest.)         suburbistan: p234 #infsum Good night all!                                 peterknox: UES #infsum                                  CAlex6977: geen locatieThis is how my night went. #infsum                                  mona_s: Jack is also getting into Infinite Jest #infsum                                   piscivorous: @donaldtaylorii's heavily bookmarked copy of IJ from Thursday's meetup #infsum                                 @D3WEY: #infsum Mammy learns to read.                                  @katieschenk: Layover in Minneapolis. #infsum                                    @joel_meyer: IJ at the campsite near Beacon, NY.
