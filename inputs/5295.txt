At MLA 2014, I am presenting on a panel, "Vulnerability and Survivalism of the Humanities in Corporatized Academia," organized by the Community College Humanities Association. The panel is part of the Vulnerable Times Presidential Theme, and I will be speaking alongside Steven Hymowech, Lee Skallerup Bessette, George Louis Scheper, Paul Lauter, and Stacey Lee Donohue. The following post offers a short glimpse into the content of my presentation. The final draft of my presentation is published here.I find myself increasingly unwilling to rest on my own privilege. In August 2013, I accepted a tenure-track position at University of Wisconsin-Madison. I’m working in the Division of Continuing Studies, advocating for lifelong learning and what I call the public digital humanities.In my previous position, I was Faculty and Director of a new hybrid digital humanities degree program at a small liberal arts institution in Portland, OR. I had taken the job with the belief that it would be my career for 10 years or more. It was a full-time position with benefits, not tenure-track but within a system that was described to me as “tenure-equivalent.” My colleagues seemed collegial, the campus was lovely, and the students were some of the best I’d worked with in my 15 years of teaching.
