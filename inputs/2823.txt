The following CFP came across the NINES desk, and we thought it would be of interest to many of our users.Â âThe Uses of âReligionâ in 19th Century Studies” takes placeÂ at the Armstrong Browning Library (ABL) at Baylor University Mar. 16-19, 2016. The conference will engage questions being asked ever more frequently among scholars of the nineteenth-century in a variety of disciplines concerning the category, “religion.” Scholars have noted that the modern, Western category of âreligionâ is a unique historical construction, which has grown up alongside notions of âthe secular,â and been deeply entangled with the formation of state power, imperial expansion, and unfavorable portrayals of non-Europeans. The conference invites presentations that seek to advance scholarship on nineteenth-century literature and culture by critically reflecting on the historical formations of âreligionâ and the uses to which the concept has been put. 15 proposals will be accepted for the conference. More information about âThe Uses of âReligionâ in 19th Century Studies,â including a CFP, can be found through the ABLâs web site: http://www.browninglibrary.org/
