All around the world, people are getting together for Instameets, where Instagrammers gather to take lovely, fabulously filtered square photos of the world around them. It had been a challenge to effectively and elegantly map this community activity, so Instagram reached out to us to help to them out with a new map of community activity around the world.   The new, now mobile-friendly Instameet map foregrounds photos instead of standard icons, and it distinguishes between gatherings old and new. Red dots and photo borders reflect Instameets in the future, while blue dots and photo borders reflect meetings in the past. Photos along the bottom of the map are organized chronologically, too, so that itâs easy to see whatâs happening, when.    Photo selection is also much clearer and cleaner:    And you can search for locations of Instameets as well:    As a cherry on top, for people who are looking to just see whatâs out there, we implemented a simple animation cycling between featured Instameet photos.
