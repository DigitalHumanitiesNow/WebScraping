I did a workshop on Critical Pedagogy in the Digital Humanities last week. For the group, I devised the following prompt for creating a digital assignment or hybrid class. Digital Pedagogy is a recursive process, a constant interplay between building and analyzing what weâ€™ve built -- between teaching and meta-level reflection on our own process. While step number 6 below explicitly suggests bringing students into the process, I would advocate bringing students into the conversation as early as possible, even from the outset -- helping to build the syllabus, outline the objectives of the course, design activities and assessments, etc. I always start my planning for the semester or quarter at the end of the previous one by asking current students to help reconsider and redesign the course for the next term.
