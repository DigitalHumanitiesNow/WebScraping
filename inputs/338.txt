OpenCulture features a new work by cellist Daniel Crawford and geographer Scott St. George calledÂ âPlanetary Bands, Warming Worldâ and based data on global temperature variations. You can see their previous work “A Song of Our Warming Planet” on Vimeo. AsÂ Crawford explains in the video, âEach instrument represents a specific part of the Northern Hemisphere. The cello matches the temperature of the equatorial zone. The viola tracks the mid latitudes. The two violins separately follow temperatures in the high latitudes and in the arctic.â Each noteâs pitchÂ âis tuned to the average annual temperature in each region, so low notes represent cold years and high notes represent warm years.â  Source: Music for a String Quartet Made from Global Warming Data: Hear âPlanetary Bands, Warming Worldâ | Open Culture
