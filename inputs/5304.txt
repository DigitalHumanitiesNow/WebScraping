    MOOCification  from Jesse Stommel Notes from the “Digital Pedagogy and MOOCification” seminar I hosted with Sean Michael Morris for NITLE. This presentation is meant to spark conversation, debate, and collaboration around the notion that massive open online courses (MOOCs) provide opportunities to reimagine digital, hybrid, and traditional pedagogies due to the networked and large-scale nature of the courses. Because the teaching and learning challenges within MOOCs are significant, new approaches must be developed to make them effective. It’s our belief that certain of these approaches can be (and perhaps should be) applied to smaller courses, regardless of delivery (digital or analog); in fact, it’s conceivable that these new approaches are among the most valuable aspects of the advent of MOOCs.
