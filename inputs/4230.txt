This month the United Nations Human Rights Council is meeting in Geneva. One of the items on the agenda is the investigation of possible war crimes carried out by Sri Lankan authorities against the civilian Tamil population in 2009. Â The government of Sri Lanka has so far refused to allow an independent investigation to take place. Some of my students made this short video, which they've sent to the UN, asking for an impartial investigation into possible war crimes to be carried out.)
