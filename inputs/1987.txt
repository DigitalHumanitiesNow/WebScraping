Greek documentary papyri provide a rich source for linguists who wish to study Ancient Greek as it was written in everyday texts, preserved directly from antiquity. The corpus is already in digital form, but it does not contain linguistic annotation that would help linguists find interesting structures and forms. This paper presents a preliminary phase of a project focused on annotating the fragmentary and manifold papyrus material using a Dependency Treebank model.
