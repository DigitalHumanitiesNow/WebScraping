 I’m excited to be attending the HASTAC Conference for the first time in a few weeks, but I’m most excited for the alt-ac workshop that is being organized by Fiona Barnett and Korey Jackson. Fiona has written a blog post explaining the format for the workshop, which is not only free (!!) but comes with dinner for attendees. In short, however, the workshop will begin with presenters talking about their own experience in alt-ac positions, will move to looking at some sample application materials, and conclude with smaller break-out groups to workshop CVs, cover letters, and more. I’m expecting to speak quite a bit about the CLIR Postdoctoral Program (applications are due December 19!), but also about my experiences applying to many different alt-ac positions over the last several years, which I wrote about in this year’s alt-academy project. I think it’s especially valuable to be having this workshop about alt-ac right at the height of the job market for many fields in academia. Kudos to HASTAC (and Fiona, who originated the idea) for taking on the problems of reforming graduate education in a very public way.
