For this episode, Tom Scheinfeld led our podcast regulars, Dan Cohen, Stephen Robertson, Amanda French, and Mills Kelly, in a Halloween episode produced by Jordan Bratt and Jannelle Legg. After a brief discussion of Halloween plans, the group delved into the subject of copyright and creative commons as Dan described the DPLAâs involvement in an international rights meeting in Amsterdam. The discussion then led to the recent Harvard decision and the complexity of digital surrogates, creative commons, and institutional holdings. Next, Mills directed the group to the ongoing Georgia State E-reserves court case and the challenges facing public universities in the handling of copyright materials. From one scary topic to the next, Amanda introduced the subject of job interviews conducted at annual conferences and a recent publication by the MLA Executive Director, Rosemary Feal. Skype and other technologies were also addressed as the group reminisced about their experiences on both sides of the interview process. The podcast wrapped up with a shout out to a podcast listener, Allen Riddell and his Novels Project.
