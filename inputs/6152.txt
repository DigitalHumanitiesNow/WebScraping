On Friday, February 27 2015, thatcamp.org will be going offline for major server changes. I apologize for the abrupt interruption, especially to THATCamp Florida on the 28th. It is an extreme measure that I acknowledge could very well cause logistical difficulties.Previous efforts to remediate thatcamp.orgâ€˜s performance issues have made incremental progress, but its current performance remains well below what we would like to offer THATCamps. Thus, we will be making an additional hard and extreme push on February 27th to completely change THATCamp.org.I do apologize for any inconvenience, and hope that it will be very brief, and that it will improve the THATCamps that you are working so hard to make successful, enlightening, and enriching.
