Six months after the murder of Mike Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, it is worth revisiting scholars’ reflections on what his death, extrajudicial killings of people of African descent, and histories of slavery and diaspora have in common. Last August, Patrick Rael placed present-day re-articulations of respectability politics against a long history of black political rhetoric, beginning with antebellum free black activists’ debates about moral uplift as a tool against racist prejudice in the United States:   “To its progenitors, this philosophy of self-help, respectability, and uplift offered a potent means of altering the âpublic mindâ and reducing racial prejudice. Placing enormous (but misguided) faith in the rationality of the public sphere, black spokespersons offered the personal as the key place of power. In addition to its innate value (simply living a good and godly life was likely to make one more successful), self-regulation would liberate the enslaved and make equal the free. But the cost of this approach was high, as these pioneers understood. The ârespectabilityâ strategy placed great demands on a people already laboring under grave disabilities. As Jones and Allen noted, âthe judicious part of mankind will think it unreasonable, that a superior good conduct is looked for, from our race, by those who stigmatize us as men, whose baseness in incurable, and may therefore be held in a state of servitude.â Seven decades later and freedom won, black abolitionist Sarah Remond chafed under the weight of these expectations. Just months after the Civil War freed the slaves, she wrote: âWe are expected to be not only equal to the dominant races, but to excel in all that goes toward forming a noble manhood or womanhood. We are expected to develop in the highest perfection a race which for eight generations in the United States has been laden with the curse of slavery. Even some of our friends seem to expect this, but our enemies demand itâ (London Daily News, November 11, 1865).”   Read the rest: Mixing science and religion: A view of Ferguson from the early republic.Filed under: Patrick Rael Tagged: 19th century, blogroll, essay, ferguson, free people of color, politics, slavery, united states
