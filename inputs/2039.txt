SAWS uses digital technologies to analyse wisdom literatures in Greek and Arabic.         Throughout Antiquity and the Middle Ages collections of wise sayings (gnomologia) were circulated as a         response to the cost and inaccessibility of full texts. These moral and philosophical anthologies formed a         crucial route by which ideas of reasonable behaviour were disseminated over the course of centuries. We         are publishing gnomologia using TEI XML and developing a series of explanatory links in RDF between         sections of collections, their source texts, and texts which drew upon them. This paper discusses challenges         in publishing and linking these texts.
