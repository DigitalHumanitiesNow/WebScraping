Paula's CSS tutorial on footnotes has made me think of some other ways to implement footnotes using CSS. I've tried to streamline Paula's version by styling only the <a> by applying a class="note".  Instead of putting <a> inside <span class="refnote"> (as Paula does)or <sup>, we can simply style the <a>. See the CSS below:   body {     font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;     font-size: 76%;     color: #333;     width: 800px;     } a.note {     vertical-align:super;     font-size: 0.8em;     line-height:0;     padding: 3px 5px;     background-color: #ccc;     color: #333;     text-decoration:none;     margin: 0 0.20em;     } a.note:hover {     background-color: #ffc;     color: #900;     } p {     line-height: 2em;     font-weight: 1em;     }   See the example.  This seems to work fine on the following browsers: Windows - Opera 8, IE 6, Firefox; Mac - Safari, Firefox, IE5. Feel free to let me know if there are problems with other broswers.
