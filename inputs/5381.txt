Altmetrics tracks usage of these and similar tools to measure scholarly influence on the social web. Altmetrics researchers and practitioners have amassed a growing body of literature and working tools to gather and analyze altmetrics and there is growing interest in this emerging subfield of scientometrics. Panelists will present results demonstrating the utility of alternative metrics from a variety of stakeholders: researchers, librarians, publishers and those participating in academic social media sites.Thanks to Jose Kruse /Source and Links Available At[https://www.asis.org/asist2013/abstracts/panels/23.html]
