Database technology profoundly altered the scope and power of the         prosopography; more recently developed technologies have the potential to transform the genre         yet again. Advances in the areas of digitised social network analysis, natural language processing,         and ontological reasoning have the potential not only to extend the research reach and utility of the         prosopography, but also to allow us to ask new questions of the past. The purpose of this paper is         to outline these new technologies and tentatively to explore where these new questions might         take us.
