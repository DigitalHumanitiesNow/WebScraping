I know I haven’t kept up with this blog but it’s not because I’ve stopped writing or blogging. Most of my latest writings have been at “The Message” collection over at the Medium. (Yes, The Message at the Medium.) Â Click here for a list of the latest. I’ve written on a variety of topics ranging from algorithms to Ebola (and networks, institutions and globalization). I’ve also written some more academic articles (many of which are here). You can also track many of them through my Google Scholar page. My new year’s resolution is to do a better job of keeping a central inventory of all my writing! My other goal is to get more of my PDF publications into plaint-text and HTML formats.Â My (lame) excuse is that I’m too busy writing! I promise to improve… soon. Â In the meantime, drop me a line at zeynep at technosociology dot org for requests of copies of papers (or for press inquiries).
