We are now working on getting together the ELMCIP Project Final Report, which will be published by ELMCIP in cooperation with the Computing Literature Series at West Virginia University Press and will included chapters by all of the principle investigators contributing the project. I recently completed the draft of the ELMCIP Electronic Literature Knowledge Base Project Report, an extensive report detailing the development process, information architecture, and technical platform of the Knowledge Base. I wrote the report with some help and input from Eric Dean Rasmussen, who was a funded researcher on the project for the first year and a half of the development project and served as the Knowledge Base Editor.
