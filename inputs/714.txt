Here is an excerpt from a paper I gave at MLA about Ira’s visualization experiments: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Digital artist Ira Greenberg has created for the Poetess archive several types of visualizations using XML-encoded documents.Â  The text we used is Felicia Hemansâs poem âDomestic Affections.âÂ  The first visualization is a word fountain.Â  Based on word count, this dynamic picture alphabetizes the words and shoots up water: the higher the water, the greater number of times that word appears in the poem.Â  The highest water spurts correspond to words such as âtheâ and âa,â so we are really interested in this middle range.Â  If one scrolls over it, the word appears on top.Â   As is visible here, in âpoetessâ poetry, âdeathâ is prominent: âDomestic Affectionsâ describes a womanâs desire to have her genius recognized as such, allegedly with fatal consequence.Â   Here you see the cursor discovering in higher spurts of water âshe, serene, shade, shadowy, seraph-dreams,â a rather nice list of attributes for what she needs to be and why death might therefore be needed to neutralize a womanâs intellect. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Another visualization crated by Greenberg is what I call an elocutionary diagram.Â Â   What you see here is of course a still fromÂ an animated visualization.Â  Here a worm-like creature crawls through the poem â through âDomestic Affectionsâ â pausing at each punctuation mark for an amount of time determined by the markâs relative punctuating force.Â  A comma generates a curvature in theÂ  arthropodâs body, an exclamation point causes it to stop for a longer period of time and so its tail crashes into its head generating a series of large V shapes.Â  Here we see, in other words, the poemâs elocutionary force pictured as movement through time.Â  Why do Vs cluster and clatter here, why gently rolling comma-lulls there? Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Finally Greenberg developed a color wheel visualization based on positive (red), negative (blue), and neutral (gray) terms.  Concentric rings moving out represent each line in the poem from beginning to end.Â  Here we see its emotional ups and downs, how they cluster, contrast, compare.Â  It is interesting to see that our perception of the color gray or neutrality is affected by the colors surrounding it, just as a peaceful moment after being almost hit by a bus differs from a peaceful moment when one wakes up after pleasant dreams.Â  One sees here not only where positive terms dominate and where sadness prevails, but how such alterations affect one another.
