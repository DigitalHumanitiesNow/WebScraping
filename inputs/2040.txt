The SPQR project (http://spqr.cerch.kcl.ac.uk) is investigating the integration of heterogeneous datasets relating to Classical antiquity via Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies to produce an intuitive way for researchers to explore the data. EpiDoc XML (including the Inscriptions of Aphrodisias and Inscriptions of Roman Tripolitania) has been converted into Linked Data. In addition to relationships arising from shared properties of the objects, such as the materials from which they are made, there are links to external resources such as the Pleiades gazetteer of ancient places. A user evaluation by classicists at KCL of the tools and techniques used is under way.
