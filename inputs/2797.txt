The source image in this post is very much like the source image in my previous post, Whatâs an Aesthetic? Early morning, misty, shooting from Hoboken toward Manhattan. So weâve got the Manhattan skyline ghostlike in the background and, in the foreground, we have a street lamp (rather than a pair of banners).Hereâs three variations. Obviously Iâm not trying to make these look like something your eye might have seen at the spot. Iâm just playing around with the additive primary colors: red, green and blue.Here I simply âinvertedâ the first image (swapping the original colors for their complements), which is easy to do in photoshop:That too has its interest.But this is something else, and rather more interesting, no?Photoshop has a number of distortion filters. To get this image I used one called Twirl: Imagine the image floating on the surface of a pond. Now dip a stick in the pond and twirl it. I took the twirled version and blended it with the original, which is also easy to do in Photoshop. There are in fact endless ways to do it. So many I donât remember just which one I used to get this one. I might not be able to reproduce it from the original.Is that a feature or a bug?* * * * *Many of the posts tagged âphotographyâ raise similar issues.
