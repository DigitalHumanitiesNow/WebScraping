In this seminar we describe the methodology and present preliminary results of a project using multispectral imaging to document the deterioration of parchment. A series of treatments has been applied to degrade samples from a deaccessioned manuscript using both physical and chemical agents. Each sample has been photographed before and after the treatment by a multispectral imaging system to record the effect of the treatments on both the writing and the parchment. We present the initial imaging of the samples, details on their treatment agents and how they affect the writing and parchment, the final imaging, and some image processing analysis.
