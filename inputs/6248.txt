The Emergence of DH was just thoroughly reviewed in Reviews in History by James Baker, who’s a historian and a Curator in the Digital Research team at the British Library. It’s particularly interesting to see a historian’s view, and the review is quite positive. Baker’s right, though, to point to my own background in literary and cultural studies and to suggest that the emergence could be “mapped more widely,” including “work clustered around centres, faculties, departments and libraries across Europe, Australia, South America, India, work undertaken by historians, geographers, musicologists, archaeologists, linguists, and art historians, as well as literary and new media scholars.” Some of that mapping is already underway by other scholars, and I look forward to seeing more of it in the future.
