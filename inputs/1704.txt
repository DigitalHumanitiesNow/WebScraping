One of the reasons I wanted to get the I-131 done before Christmas is that all the major treatment of my thyroid cancer would be over by the end of 2013. It worked: i got a call last week from my endocrinologist telling me the post-radiation scan came back clear. Definitely moving on to maintenance mode now. There are days when it’s frustrating to know that I have to take a tiny pill every morning or I’ll be madly hypothyroid. I will never survive a zombie apocalypse or alien attack. Still, I’m not alone in my dependence. And it’s a small price for a cancer-free life.
