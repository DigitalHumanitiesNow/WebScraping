Via if:book, Forbes has a nice collection of essays on the present and future development of books. From the introductory article:  Are books in danger?  The conventional wisdom would say yes. After all, more and more media--the Internet, cable television, satellite radio, videogames--compete for our time. And the Web in particular, with its emphasis on textual snippets, skimming and collaborative creation, seems ill-suited to nurture the sustained, authoritative transmission of complex ideas that has been the historical purview of the printed page.  But surprise--the conventional wisdom is wrong. Our special report on books and the future of publishing is brim-full of reasons to be optimistic. People are reading more, not less. The Internet is fueling literacy. Giving books away online increases off-line readership. New forms of expression--wikis, networked books--are blossoming in a digital hothouse.  People still burn books. But that only means that books are still dangerous enough to destroy. And if people want to destroy them, they are valuable enough that they will endure.  I do think that new media have caused renegotiations of how books are defined, and how the author/reader relationship or "social contract" is constructed. But I've never quite understood the fear that books are going away because of the internet. I've seen web design and development books flourish over the past few years. Book on blogging, blogging, grow in number every year and sell with success. And putting book content online has not hindered book development in the slightest. In fact, it has encouraged the success of books.
