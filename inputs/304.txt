 Back from FOSS4G In my experience, FOSS4G was tons of fun and very well run. Chapeau to the organizing team! I hope other attendees got as much out of the conference as I did. Not only did I get to catch up with people I met at the dawn of FOSS4G, I met great people I’d only known from Twitter and made entirely new acquaintances. I even got to speak a bit of French. My talk was one of the first in the general sessions. I had fun presenting and am told that I did a good job. My slides are published at http://sgillies.github.io/foss4g-2014-fiona-rasterio/ and you can fork them from GitHub. According to the information at the FOSS4G Live Stream page all the talks will be available online soon. I missed plenty that I’m looking forward to seeing on my computer. Out of the ones I attended, I particularly recommend seeing the following: “Using OpenStreetMap Infrastructure to Collect Data for our National Parks” by James McAndrew, National Park Service “Managing public data on GitHub: Pay no attention to that git behind the curtain” by Landon Reed, Atlanta Regional Commission “Big (enough) data and strategies for distributed geoprocessing” by Robin Kraft, World Resources Institute “An Automated, Open Source Pipeline for Mass Production of 2 m/px DEMs from Commercial Stereo Imagery” by David Shean, University of Washington Did the code of conduct work? I heard one speaker invoke images of barely competent moms â “so easy your mother can do it” â and was present for a unfortunate reference to hacking private photos at lunch time. I hope that was all of it. If you attended FOSS4G or watched the live feed I encourage you to write about your experience and impressions. Come on, do it. It doesn’t have to be long or comprehensive. Here are a few blog posts I’ve seen already: Foss4g 2014: The good, the bad and the beers   by Atle Frenvik Sveen
