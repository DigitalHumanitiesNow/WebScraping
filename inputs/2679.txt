Yesterday I foolishly uploaded a Pages document to my work machine (that isn't a Mac) before heading into the office. I needed the content because I was due to give it to Susan that morning. Luckily I stumbled upon this tip and thought I'd share it in case you ever find yourself faced with a Mac disk full of documents and no Mac to read them on...I guess I shouldn't have been surprised to discover a Pages document is in fact a zip file (like Word docs) and if you unpack it not only do you find an XML representation of the document (which would let you get at the text - run it through tidy first though as there aren't any line breaks!) or, neater, in the QuickLook directory is a PDF (file reports PDF 1.3) of the document.Day saved! Phew!
