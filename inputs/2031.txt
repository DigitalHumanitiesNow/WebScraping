This seminar will focus on the work of the Portable Antiquities Scheme,          which has been systematically recording public discovery of archaeological objects within the          boundaries of England and Wales digitally since 1999. Over 725000 objects have now been          recorded and 19,000 people have contributed information which is ultimately being used for a          wide variety of research. Records include iconic discoveries such as the Moorlands Staffordshire         patera or trulla, the immense Frome hoard, the infamous Crosby Garrett Helmet, the world famous         Staffordshire Hoard, and more mundane, everyday items that can demonstrate more about rural          habitation of Britain.
