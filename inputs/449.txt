Slow week, or am I at fault for not paying attention to the augmentosphere?Qualcomm releases an iOS version of their AR SDK. I guess now I'm left out of excuses for not developing any AR app on my own.Face detection is coming in iOS5, but will be probably used only to make "funny" pictures.Cool augmented dressing room, powered by Kinect, which makes the clothes look a little bit more realistic and less pasted on your body. (via augmented.org)AR on billboards: dance with virtual dancers in Kuala Lumpur.AR Dodge Ball from TU Munich. Is it a HUD on your face or are you just a weirdo?This week's video is without a doubt this one from The Heavy Projects - I never got so many retweets as I did after tweeting about it (if you don't follow me I'm @augmented). Harnessing the power of Junaio, the billboards of Times Square are repainted with original street art.

I just wonder whether it's ok with Junaio's terms of use.Augmented Reality Advertising Takeover in Times Square from Will Sherman on Vimeo.Have a great week!
