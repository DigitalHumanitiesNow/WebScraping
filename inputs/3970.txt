 There’s a publisher (and an editor) I want to tell you about. Brian White is the mastermind behind Fireside Fiction, which puts out Fireside Magazine. Fireside pays 12.5 cents a word for fiction. They work with diverse writers and artists. Fireside isn’t just a magazine publishing genre fiction (and yes, they mean any genre), it’s a community. Writers who make friends and care about each other as people, and as peers. Artists who can say with pride that they share common ground as artists for Fireside. And “slush” readers, the never trumpeted enough entry point of publication, the submissions editors who pass stories up the chain, circled many times with You have to buy this. Fireside is also its readers, who are brought together by their love of their favorite authors, being given a chance to discover new favorites. All of this make Fireside amazing, and the man spinning the plates behind this is one of the best editors I have had the pleasure to call a peer, and a friend. I don’t need a reason to call out good work or good people. But Brian’s birthday is this Saturday, and whether you know him or not, becoming a part of Fireside would be the perfect gift. Submit fiction. Buy back issues. Support their Patreon. Preorder Revision, the first novel Fireside Fiction is releasing, a flat out amazing sci-fi novel by Andrea Philips. Gift friends who need new fiction a subscription. Be a part of something strange and luminous and great.
