In Winter of this year, I worked with Kathi Inman Berens and four amazing Marylhurst students, Carrie Padian, Ken Schultz, Jessica Zisa, and Lans Nelson, to create a social media campaign to promote the inaugural E-literature Showcase at the Library of Congress. We built spine poems, took some pictures, made a video, and then invited the rest of the internet to join in the fun. The results are at spinepoetry.com. My personal favorite is the spine poem made by my dog Mary (with a little help from her dad), which also got her featured in the Portland Tribune. You can find out more about the works on display at the Library of Congress at the marvelous site made by Dene Grigar and her students at UW Vancouver.
