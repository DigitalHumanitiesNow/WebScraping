A Vanity Fair article was published online today about James Bridle and the New Aesthetic, “Children of the Drone.”       The piece quotes Paola Antonelli of MOMA as calling the movement (a term Bridle doesn’t like) “a group effort to try and describe the coming together of the physical and the digital–which is the dimension where we will live the most in the future.â The article makes a start at pointing to the political implications of the "aesthetic”–one interviewee connects it to the War on Terror–that today’s blog post by Bridle develops more explicitly. Here’s one summary he makes:    The New Aesthetic is not superficial, it is not concerned with beauty or surface texture. It is deeply engaged with the politics and politicisation of networked technology, and seeks to explore, catalogue, categorise, connect and interrogate these things.   Of particularly interest to me is Bridle’s suggestion that a “low-level Luddite response” to technology, a widespread “weak technological literacy in the arts”–and “a far wider critical and popular failure to engage fully with technology in its construction, operation and affect”–has reinforced the “superficial” readings of the movement. As he concludes, “we live in a world shaped and defined by computation, and it is one of the jobs of the critic and the artist to draw attention to the world as it truly is.”
