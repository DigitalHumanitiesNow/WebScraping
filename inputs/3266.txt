 I’m very pleased to announce that after more than two and a half years of work (i.e., more time than my daughter has been alive), the special issue of Neo-Victorian Studies on steampunk that I co-edited with my great friend Rachel Bowser (who is frustratingly not present online). We’re exceptionally proud of the articles that came out of this endeavor and are grateful for the authors who worked so hard on meeting deadlines and on going through revisions. We are also grateful for the NVS editorial board and General and Founding Editor Marie-Luise Kohlke in particular.
