This paper will discuss a proposed digital platform for exploring differences among translations, including proof-of-concept work on 37 German versions of Othello dating from 1766 to 2010: translations, adaptations, rewritings; reading editions, theatre scripts, student cribs. We shall next collect up to 180 versions of Hamlet and The Merchant of Venice in 12 languages, and develop a suite of analytic tools for explorative and educational uses. We shall also explore other sets of translations, including English and Czech versions of Euripides' Medea. Alternative versions are not only of interest for studies of a work's reception, of target cultures, and of translation or versioning processes; translations can also be mined to tell us things we did not know about the translated works themselves..
