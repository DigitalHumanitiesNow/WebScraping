Instrumentation: Turntables (DJ) Born in Lima, Peru, Maria Chavez is mainly recognized in the art community as an improviser, sound artist and curator. Her sound installations, visual objects and live turntable performances focus on the values of accidents and itâs unique, complicated possibilities with sound emitting machinery like the turntable. Influenced by improvisation in contemporary art, her work expands outside of the sound world straddling different disciplines of interest. This year, Chavez wrote and illustrated her first book object entitled, Of Technique: Chance Procedures on Turntable. The book serves as a how-to manual for those interested in learning the abstract turntablism techniques that she developed with the turntable. âWhile the contents of the book serve a practical means, the book as a whole is intended to be an interactive art piece.â http://www.mariachavez.org/
