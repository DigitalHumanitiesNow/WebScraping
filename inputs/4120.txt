The British History Online team gave a presentation at a conference celebrating the 175th anniversary of the Belgian Royal Historical Commission (CRH) on 29 April 2009. The conference addressed ‘The digital edition of sources in Europe: achievements, problems and prospects’, and we discussed the steps that BHO has taken to tackle questions of academic, technical and financial sustainability. Other speakers were from the Institute of Netherlands History in the Hague, the Austrian Academy of Science, the Monumenta Germaniae Historica, the Ecole Nationale des Chartes and the universities of Nancy, Cologne and Gent. The papers from the conference will be published online by the CRH.
