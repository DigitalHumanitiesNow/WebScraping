Nils Weidmann has put together cshapes, a useful package for R that gives you country boundaries and capitals for the years 1946 to 2008. This package is based on his cshapes shapefile. (Via Elijah Meeks.) This is a nice model for packaging historical geographic information for R. Iâm hoping to do something similar for the Newberry Libraryâs Atlas of Historical County Boundaries.
