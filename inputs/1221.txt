The History News Network is covering the 2006 AHA meeting in Philadelphia. A few Cliopatriarchs plan to be in attendance and will host a panel entitled "Were All the World a Blog: History Bloggers and History Blogging". I'm looking foward to meeting some of the people whose blogs I read...should be fun!
