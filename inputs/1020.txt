C.H.L. George is blogging about the research for her 2005 PhD thesis at Topical Portrait Prints, 1660-1714. George's topic is, as you may have guessed from the title, topical portrait print advertisements from London newspapers in the 17th and 18th centuries. George provides information on specific advertisements and collections consulted for the thesis and talks about the benefits of blogging a PhD after graduating. (Namely, the opportunity to reflect and reevaluate your work.)
