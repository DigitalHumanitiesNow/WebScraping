ugh, AERA. I mean, hooray, AERA! In the land of educational research, a pretty enormous conference is coming up–the Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research Association (AERA). I’m the Communications Chair of AERA’s Cultural-Historical Research Special Interest Group, and I sort of like distributing advice forÂ navigating this most intimidating of conferences. Today, I’m offering advice on how to navigate one specific aspect of this conference–the question-and-answer section of presentations.Â Advice is divided into two sections. The first section addresses how to field questions at the end of your talk. The second addresses how to be a respectful and productive question-asker.   If youâre the speaker: Fielding good and/or obnoxious audience questions First, readÂ this Times Higher Education articleÂ that lists the six conference questions every academic hears. The question types are: the Courtesy Question, the Tell-Us-What-You-Want Question, the Talk-To-Me-Personally Question, the Wandering Statement, the Obstinate Question, and the Display of Superior Knowledge. Of these six, the author notes that the Display of Superior Knowledge is âby far the most unbearable of audience responsesâ (about which more below, in the section on how to be a respectful and productive question-asker). Nick Hop writes thatÂ you can be amazing or awful at answering questions from the audienceâitâs your choice. The authorÂ explains that there are two pathways through the Q&A section of your talk: Option A: come across like a thoughtful, open-minded, well-prepared scholar who listens attentively and is keen to engage with the people who have turned up to listen to you Option B: come across like a defensive, narrow-minded, rigid scholar who is âwinging itâ through not only the conference but their whole PhD, a know-it-all who doesnât want to be challenged or think differently about anything. Hop assumes you want to go with Option A, and offers advice on how to address all sorts of different questions with Option A in mind. Hop summarizes Q&A advice as follows: Diagnose the question (if indeed it is a question) type and what this tells you about the questioner and her/his motives or expectations Avoid responses that fuel flames and lead to heated dialogue Be prepared to think through before giving an answer Be prepared not to give an answer Have an answer pre-prepared on your slides! For the conspiracy theorists among you: you can either conspire with arseholes who are out to get you, or with the audience who see the arseholes for what and who they are. Go for the latter.Â Politely.  If youâre the asker: How not to be an asshole Look, weâve all been to talks where some audience member stands up and asks That Question, right? The one thatâs intended either to embarrass the speaker or to make the question-asker look like the smartest guy in the room. Maybe weâve even asked that kind of question in the past! Which is ok! Weâre all learning as we go here! You can decide for yourself how you want to show up at other peopleâs talks, but I include some advice below thatâs intended to direct you to the kinds of questions that will most clearly align with your motives for attending a given talk. There are several scenarios that might lead you to attending an AERA presentation. Scenario 1: Youâre at a talk to support a mentee or newer graduate student. In this case, your goal is probably to help the speaker shine and/or to commiserate afterward about weird questions asked by audience members. Generally speaking, it feels pretty scary to give an AERA talk when youâre a graduate student, and it feels pretty awesome to have successfully navigated the Q&A. Your mentee/peer/classmate probably WANTS to engage with people who donât know their work as well as you do, so your best bet here is to have a question ready just in case thereâs an awkward silenceâbut to avoid asking it if possible. You have all the time in the world to ask your questions once you get back to University Town, State, Country. Scenario 2: Youâre at a talk to support a friend/convince them to go to lunch with you after their talk. In this case, your goal is probably to be their ally, and to ensure they feel good enough and/or righteously angry enough to be willing to skip out on the next Sponsored Session in favor of tryingÂ that gluten free restaurant youâve heard so much about. The advice here is similar to that of Scenario 1, except in this case you should also consider jotting notes about the most outrageous audience questions so you can rehash them over cherry mango smoothies afterward. Scenario 3: Youâre at a talk because the topic interests you and you want to learn more about it. This is perhaps the bestâand, letâs admit it, the least commonâreason to attend a talk. If youâre at a talk for this reason and you have a question you want to ask, itâs probably an authentic question that emerged out of curiosity or confusion. Go ahead and ask! There may be others in the audience with a similar question.Â  Scenario 4: Youâre at a talk because itâs directly related to the work you do. Your attendance at this talk may be about checking out the competition, and it may be about learning more about how other people are exploring topics related to your work. If this is why youâre at a talk, itâs going to be super easy for you to feel combative and nitpickyâthis is what academia trains us to be! It may also help to remember that time your attendance at a talk was motivated by Scenarios 1, 2, or 3 above, and someone in the audience stood up and asked a combative and/or nitpicky question. If you really want to get into the details of your shared interests, the final 5-10 minutes of a conference presentation is not the time to do it. Instead, consider approaching the speaker after the talk and asking them toÂ talk over coffee.Â  Scenario 5: Youâre at a talk because the speaker is a personal hero. In this case, you might really want the speaker to notice you, and you might think one way to make this happen is to ask a really thoughtful and clever question. Actually, youâre right. So think super hard during the talk about the question you want to ask. Maybe consider writing it down. Consider getting your hand in the air before anybody else, because your question is so thoughtful and clever that you think everybody will want to hear the speakerâs response to it! Itâs ok if your voice shakes when you ask your questionâeverybody gets nervous sometimes! Also, consider approaching the speaker afterward and telling them how excited you were to hear them speak and/or one thing you really enjoyed about their talk. Then consider being the bravest guy in the room and asking if your personal hero has time to meet for coffee. Scenario 6: Youâre at a talk on accident, because you got lost and/or the other hotels are too far away and/or youâre hung over from last nightâs social event. This is a really great reason to be at a talkâit means youâre going to learn about something new that probably wasnât even on your radar before you entered that presentation room. Write down everything that confuses you! Consider keeping your laptop or mobile device open during the talk so you can look up unfamiliar terms and scholars! If you have questions, thereâs a slight chance that asking them might make you look ignorant but a much greater chance that asking them will start a cross-disciplinary conversation that results in some amazing synergy between divergent areas of scholarship! Also, make sure to drink lots of water during the talk. Water is great for easing hangover symptoms.   Tweet This Post
