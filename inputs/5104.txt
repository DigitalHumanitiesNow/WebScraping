Despite being open to anyone to edit, Wikipedia has beenÂ criticized for its gender gap. To help remedy this,Â Postcolonial Digital HumanitiesÂ is organizing aÂ Global Women Write-InÂ (#GWWI) on WikipediaÂ all-day tomorrow on March 18!Â  Why Global Women?Â  Â If youâve ever tried doing a Wikipedia search for important women theorists around the world, you might be surprised to note how short the entries are, particularly on their work and their ideas (for example:Â Chandra Talpade Mohanty,Â Gayatri Spivak,Â bell hooks,Â Gloria Anzaldua,Â Vandana Shiva, andSara Ahmed). Many important women of color, such as Oyeronke Oyewumi, Â lack entries or stubsÂ in Wikipedia. Additionally, coverage of international events involving women is brief or nonexistent (for example:Â the 1929 Aba Womenâs Riots in Nigeria;Â Domitila Barrios de ChÃºngara; and Angkatan Wanita Sedar or âForce of Awakened Women,â an important feminist group in Malaysian history). These gaps in Wikipediaâs knowledge base are striking and important, especially since Wikipedia is now the most commonly referenced encyclopedia globally. These gapsâparticularly theÂ gender gapâhave been subject to study. According to the Wikimedia Wikipediaâs Editorâs Survey of 2011, âIf there is a typical Wikipedia editor, he has a college degree, is 30-years-old, is computer savvy but not necessarily a programmer, doesnât actually spend much time playing games, and lives in US or Europe.â Join In! Join us virtuallyÂ by doing your work during our edit-a-thon. If youâre on Twitter, send out a Tweet that includes the hashtag #GWWIÂ to let us know youâre out there.
