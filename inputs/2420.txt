Thanks to Sobek Digital for sharing new training videos on new features, including the new video on “Adding a new collection using theÂ Add New Collection Wizard“.Â Â It’s fabulous to see the SobekCM Open Source Digital Repository SoftwareÂ continue to grow and flourish with new enhancements, so much so that it can be hard to keep up! Thanks go toÂ Sobek DigitalÂ for sharing the new training videos, as well as for contributions to code and support. I’m looking forward to seeing updated documentation with user guides for community members from the many members of SobekCM’s large and rapidly growing community!
