   Brainstorming the @PubPhilJ  Originally uploaded by cplong11   Mark Fisher, Lecturer and Director of Teaching and Learning with Technologies in the Philosophy Department and Assistant Director of the Rock Ethics Institute, joins me for episode 61 of the Digital Dialogue to talk about the vision and development of the Public Philosophy Journal. The Public Philosophy Journal is an open peer review journal that attempts to perform public philosophy as its mode of publication. These are the five steps involved in that process: Curate and Amplify: Current digital public philosophy discussions and pertinent web content will be curated through the use of existing web-crawling technology (like PressForward) that will bring them to the attention of members of a world-wide community of scholars, graduate students, and policy makers, whose evaluations will serve to filter out the less promising contributions to the discourse and to determine which contributions will be amplified even further; 	Review: The journal will include mechanisms for open peer review of curated and submitted content, including a system for reviewing and credentialing reviewers and incentives for careful reading and for consistent and thoughtful commenting; 	Enrich and Develop: Digital public philosophy will be greatly enriched by creating a space of collaborative developmental writing that will start with the most promising content identified in the review process and lead to the publication of rigorous scholarly articles; 	Publish: Reviewed articles will be openly published together with invited responses to the reviewed work; 	Cultivate: Ongoing open dialogue about the published articles will be cultivated by invited and curated responses that have the potential to feed the development of new collaborative scholarship.
