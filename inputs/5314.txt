In the field of digital literature, media blur one into another.  A single piece of digital literature might draw on the literary tools of fiction, poetry, painting, photography, film, etc.  The best works, though, force us to question the distinction between media altogether.  The question "what is a poem?" becomes "what (if anything) does the medium tell us about a work?"  Because the very concept of the artistic medium is troubled from the start, the close-reader of a digital work has no predetermined analytical strategies or tools to bring to the work.  We are, instead, forced to either draw on techniques used in the analysis of existing media or to throw out those techniques and discover new ones.  As I approach the task of close-reading Andy Campbell's "Spawn," it seems sensible to do a little of both.
