“To me, the central thesis of Dark Matter is not that every museum ought to aspire to the audience of the Khan Academy, nor that technology is the new Messiah come to save museums from economic oblivion. My reading is that there is a need for us to focus on what it would mean to provide a platform for contemporary audiences to reflect on the full chaos and complexity of our lived experience. Not just as a project or an exhibition, but for that to become what the word âmuseumâ means in the collective psyche.” [1] [1] Nicholas Poole, “Change,” Code|Words: Technology and Theory in the Museum.
