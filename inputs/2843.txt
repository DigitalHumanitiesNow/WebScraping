The 2013 legislative session kicked off today. I've got a lot on my mind already, but I'll ask for just one simple favor  as we move forward with these critical conversations. I'm asking for a couple of changes in vocabulary. I know it seems nit-picky, but I actually think these are powerful changes. Could we please replace ACHIEVEMENT with LEARNING, as achievement has been connotatively defined as results on standardized tests? Our focus needs to be on ensuring each and every child experiences significant learning every single day. Can we also talk about TRANSFORMATION rather than REFORM? We don't need a new spoiler for the old Pinto; we need a new car. We've reformed this system beyond its usability. Can we please start defining a brand new system?
