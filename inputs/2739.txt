Today is a special day! Today marks the soft launch of a new website for the Essex Kent Mennonite Historical Association (EKMHA): http://ekmha.ca Special thanks go to Bruno Penner, Walt Koop, Astrid Koop, Katie Brown, Helga Harder, and Carol Sawatzky for their collaboration, enthusiasm, patience, and outstanding teamwork as we developed the new site over the past several months. At last, the hard work has paid off and the new site is ready for traffic. The new site launches just in time for the EKMHA community to share with friends and family over the holidays. One special feature of the new site is the Voices of Essex-Kent Mennonites project, an effort to collect and share stories of the first Mennonites to come to Essex-Kent, as well as stories about their descendants. It is EKMHAâ€™s hope that people from Essex and Kent Counties and beyond will add their family members, photographs, videos, audioclips, and stories to the collection so that they can be preserved and shared with the larger community. The new website is built using WordPress and Omeka, two open source software packages used by many small museums; the new site marks a major shift from the static html pages the organization was using that were difficult to update. Each of the volunteers on the website committee has learned to post using WordPress so that the site will stay up-to-date, with new content added regularly. Starting in January 2013, new content will be added to the site every Monday morning. Please send your feedback, comments, or suggestions about the new EKMHA website to feedback@ekmha.ca and stay tuned for information about the official launch party and site demo to be held in the Heritage Centre in Leamington in January.
