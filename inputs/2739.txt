Project Development We will install a web development environment. There are several choices depending on your OS, flexibility, and ease of use. I have listed three options below. If you know you might want to experiment with software other than WordPress I would recommend either MAMP or WAMP; however, if you are sure that you will use WordPressâbased on the proposals and our in-class from last week, most of you will be able to complete your project using WordPressâthen I would choose the Desktop Server option. MAMP (Mac OSX Only: Apache, MySQL, PHP) Installation: Smashing Mag Installation: WordPress Codex  WAMP (Windows Only: Apache, MySQL, PHP) Installation: WAMP Installation: WordPress Codex  Desktop Server (Cross-platform: Apache, MySQL, PHP w/ WordPress included) Installation: DeskTop Server Installation: WordPress Codex  Permalinks (Permalinks are the pretty URLs http://localhost/archive/web-dev/ versus WordPress default permalink structure http://foo.com/?p=123). Permalinks are not absolutely necessary in a development environment but are useful. To enable pretty permalinks, you will need to modify some core files: WAMP: How to Change and WAMP: Making Pretty Permalinks MAMP: The MAMP article from Smashing Mag includes instructions on setting up pretty permalinks. Desktop Server: I was not able to find out if pretty permalinks work or not in Desktop Server, but I would venture to guess that they are supported (automagically).  Tasks Reading / Proposals Install Server Install WordPress HTML/CSS Exercise Assignment Your continuing assignment is to refine your project proposal, gather your content, and to begin mapping out your project site. The following readings are not required but highly recommended (especially the Boggs posts) to help you further contextualize and realize your project. Content Strategy Content Strategy: The Philosophy of Data Strategic Content Management The Discipline of Content Strategy  Web Dev: Content Strategy, Information Architecture, Design, Maintainence Digital Humanities Design and Development Process Part One: Figure Out What You Are Building Part Two: Information Architecture and Organization Part Three: Design Process Part Four: Front-End Development Maintenance, Documentation, and User Feedback  If you are deeply and severely interested in web development, then I highly recommend the following books from the makers of A List Apart: HTML5 CSS3 Designing for Emotion Responsive Design Mobile First Content Strategy  Furthermore, echoing the A Book Apart Series, I also highly recommend HTML5 Boilerplate as a great starting point for creating a modern, standards-based web site, especially for those of you who already have a web dev under your belt. Warning: not for the faint-of-heart and the lazy.
