I've been meaning to start this blog for a very long time now, just as soon as I could work out what I might have to talk about.  As time passes, though, it becomes increasingly clear that (at least in my own little hybrid sector of the humanities) scholars need a web presence nearly as much as they need a decent list of publications on their CVs.  So here I am, joining the 21st-century version of the Republic of Letters.  I'll be ruminating about topics on the digital humanities, and (I very much hope) topics on Byzantine and Eastern Christian history, in the months to come.  I know there are quite a few digital humanists of various stripes in this new Republic; I hope I can ferret out a few more Byzantinists as well!
