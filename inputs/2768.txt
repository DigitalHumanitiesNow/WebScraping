The smartphone, in my case the iPhone, is the marvel of the digital/personal front of the early 21st century. I feel that I have nowâas a purported digital historian (though I think that is a suspect term in its own right)âfinally engaged the 21st century in its potential. Of course, as with other tech breakthroughs of the past (the auto, the radio, the movie, etc.) this too shall pass and to so firmly state that the smartphone is the âmarvelâ is more than likely too strong. I do, however, strongly feel that it is one of the most remarkable things to impact our lives, particularly as the POSH semantic web emerges with greater force. For me, it is the beginning of a âtrueâ realizationâat some levelâof the cyberpunk dream: cowboys, black ice, wilsons, and AI whispers in the dark.
