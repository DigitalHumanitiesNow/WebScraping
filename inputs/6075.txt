Weekends here are pretty quiet, which is actually kind of nice if you’re going to be trapped here.  We had a couple visitors and the neighbors complained about the laughing (wasn’t mine–I’m inaudible).   The latest news, though still unofficial, is that I will be home, with my neck sewn (back) shut, by a week from tomorrow.  But of course that’s an estimate and a lot can happen between now and then.  I’ve been taking pictures of the place and documenting it, as not everyone winds up in the ostomy ward.  I also have lots of thoughts on socialized medicine, hospitals as modern institutions, and all the usual academic banalities that I want to compose.  But right now I’m just happy for internet tethering.   Meantime, I was thinking of doing a “gross Q&A” post where all questions of that sort could be dealt with, if there are such questions.  The pain is fresh, the hole is new, so ask away and I’ll answer later in the week.  Plus everyone else who is too freaked out can just ignore that post. People are not shy about suggesting pain medication around here, and so I am actually going to upgrade a little bit tonight in hopes of improving sleep.  Believe it or not, I’m down to chewable Tylenol right now.
