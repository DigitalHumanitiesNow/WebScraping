Natalie Zemon Davis and I have an op-ed in today’s Globe and Mail giving some historical context to the casseroles protests.   While the Anglophone press continues to talk about disorder and how they are wrecking everything (summer festivals, school recruitment–though people actually involved in both seem considerably less worried than the journalists covering them), I think they miss the central point of the protests, which are heavily communal and precisely about order and reparation.   So, we tried to put another perspective out there. Also, it was amazing to work with Natalie on the project, which began when I interviewed her for another piece I’m doing, to appear next week.
