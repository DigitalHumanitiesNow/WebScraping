   I attended and participated in the October 2-3, 2014 Digital Strategies for Development Summit hosted by the Asian Institute of Management and held in Makati City, Philippines. The eventÂ gathered 50 speakers from around the world and more than 300 participants to focus on the role of digital and social technologies for civic needs. Â The summit focused on bringing people from many communities into a discussion of how technologyÂ can be used for: “…enabling a better society and an empowered community? How can various stakeholders, including Government, Private Sector and Civil Society gain more momentum for their core mandates by leveraging the use of digital technology enabled solutions? Can Digital Technology create a platform for better collaboration and cooperation amongst various stakeholders?” I spoke about the role social network analysis can play in understanding the emerging world of social media and computer mediated collective action.
