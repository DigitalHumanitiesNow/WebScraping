 I spend a lot of time on this blog talking about how to keep “big data” safe: research datasets, archival documents, that sort of thing. Â But, the lessons we learn here are also pretty useful for smaller setups, artists, businesses… and people at home. Â Everyone can benefit from digital preservation. Â Everyone needs to know how they can keep their digital stuff safe. And so, I’m partnering with Intervention ’11 to get the message out about how to keep your digital items of value accessible for the long run. Â I’ll be holding a panel titled “Keeping Your Stuff Safe: Strategies for Preserving Your Digital Life.” Â In that panel, we’ll be talking about ways to easily, affordably, and safely back up your digital media, for now and the future. Â What is Intervention?  Our goal is to bring together fans and different independent creators to party, educate, and appreciate the opportunities the Internet gives to all of us. We are similar to the Sci-Fi/Anime/Other fandom cons that we love so much, but we are focused on people who use the internet as the primary way to distribute their work and talk to their friends.  It’s a great event for geeks and non-geeks alike who do just about anything related to internet culture to get together for a weekend. Â Feel free to give ’em a visit!
