Although I was never expecting a deluge of email when I put my address on the contact page, I did think I might get…one, maybe two.Â  And when I didn’t I finally went and checked and low and behold, I had put the wrong address in the mailto: code. In other words, if you tried to reach me and got a bounce back, I fixed it. So try again!
