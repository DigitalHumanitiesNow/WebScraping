This one’s mostly for the search engines as I’m sure most of my readers don’t need to hear this. I keep getting this spam email sent to me:  Begin forwarded message: From: Yasmine Watson  Date: February 2, 2012 2:15:30 AM EST To:  Subject: Our Publication Offer: Your end-of-studies work Dear Essam Hallak, Some time ago I offered you the possibility of making your academic paper entitled Â«Beyond Boundaries A Philosophical Mapping of the PreModern City of the LevantÂ» submitted to McGill University Montreal as part of your postgraduate studies available as printed book. Our publishing company is interested in your subject area for future publications. Since we did not hear back from you, I am now wondering if you received my first email. I would appreciate if you could confirm your interest in our publishing house and I will be glad to provide you with detailed information about our services. I am looking forward to receiving a positive response from you. Best Regards, Yasmine Watson Acquisition Editor LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing GmbH & Co.

If I’m going to take OUP to task for their restrictive IP policies, I should also say something about these much more dangerous presses. Lambert is a print on demand publisher, not exactly vanity press in the sense that they don’t charge authors up front.  But in terms of advancing a young scholar’s career, they might as well be a vanity press.  They claim your intellectual property and publish it without proper peer review or academic editorial process, which means that they have just devalued your thesis that you might otherwise have revised, improved, and published in a more appropriate scholarly outlet (in whole or in part).  This is no small thing, as your thesis is the cornerstone of the next few years of your academic career, at least in disciplines where theses appear as books. Do not publish with Lap Lambert or other self-publication schemes.  It won’t help your career, it won’t impress hiring or postdoc committees, and it won’t get you read by your peers.  Though you might get a nicely bound book.
