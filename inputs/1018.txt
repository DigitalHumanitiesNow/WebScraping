It’s been a while since I’ve posted, but I just heard this storyÂ andÂ I felt like sharing it widely. Â Undergrad students at Davidson making maps of basketball plays and helping their team – via their coaches – be more successful than ever. Â They watch the game VERY CAREFULLY and plot the data. Â This is manual data collection, then manual data entry. Not, as the NPR story suggests, the same way that the big guys do it now, with lots of overhead cameras. Â And now that Kirk Goldberry has hit the big time in letting the world know about this strategy, it’s surely becoming a more widespread practice. I like that the guys at Davidson have figured it out on their own. I like that the first time, theyÂ turned in a “5-page essay” of the results to the coaches, and discovered how less-than-helpful that was. Â So now they produce the much more visually effective “heat maps” and help the team learn about their competition, spatially, before tip-off. Â And that they have the work-flow down to 10 minutes? Â Give these guys a hand. Â And, @NPR, next time – it’s okay to say “spatial analysis” and “GIS” as well. Of course, smart undergrads have been doing this exact thing for a while. Like the Travis Gingras fromÂ St. Lawrence who did this with hockey, almost 10 years ago!
