It is the week of Thomas Jefferson’s birthday, and everyone wishes him a happy birthday. No, reallyâliterally everyone. Currently on Salon, historian Andrew Burstein looks at the appropriation of Jefferson by both left and right, in particular the adoption of this founder of the Democratic Party by the modern-day Tea Party movement. This is just one of the apparent contradictions Burstein explores in his provocative new book, Democracy’s Muse: How Thomas Jefferson Became an FDR Liberal, a Reagan Republican, and a Tea Party Fanatic, All While Being Dead. Burstein also takes part in the Gist podcast on Slate, where he discusses Jefferson’s perplexing image in modern times.
