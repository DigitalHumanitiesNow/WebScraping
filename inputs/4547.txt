 	Registration is now open for a unique, one-day Advanced Zotero Workshop at the Harvard Kennedy School on November 8, 2013. 	The workshop is aimed at scholars who have been using Zotero for a while and would like to get even more out of the software, receive specific advice on any issues they encounter, and get all of their questions answered. Registration will remain limited to eight participants, who will benefit from a workshop targeted to their needs and interest. 	The cost to attend the workshops is $250. Sign up while there is still space! 	The workshops will be conducted by Sebastian Karcher, one of Zoteroâs most active community developers, who has a wealth of experience using, supporting, and developing Zotero. Contact him at karcher [at] u.northwestern.edu with any questions about the workshop, or if you would like to host an advanced user or Zotero trainer workshop at your own institution.
