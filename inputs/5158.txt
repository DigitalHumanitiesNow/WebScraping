 If you’ve been meaning to start exploring what it would take to integrate Wikipedia in your courses, the West Virginia University library is hosting a free webinar on teaching with Wikipedia on April 30, 10.30am-12pm EST. Â Topics that will be covered include the gender gap in Wikipedia content and editing, an introduction to editing Wikipedia, sample assignments, syllabi and instructor experiences with teaching with the online encyclopedia. The event will be led by Jami Mathewson of the Wiki Education FoundationÂ and myself. Jami is the Educational Partnerships Manager for the Foundation and will be covering an overview of issues surrounding Wikipedia and providing instructions with getting started. I will be speaking about my experiences with teaching with Wikipedia, and provide sample assignments and other resources which you can find here. If you’re interested in joining us, please register right here. After you register you will receive instructions from the training organizer about how to access the live webinar.
