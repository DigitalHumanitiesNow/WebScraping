If any of you use del.icio.us (I do. Take a look at my bookmarks), then you should check out Cocoalicious. Cocoalicious is a free, open source interface to list and view your bookmarks. I already subscribe to a few other del.icio.us feeds, so I hope to see an option in future releases of Cocoalicious that would allow me to see other del.icio.us feeds that I subscribe to. Right now I look at them in my Sage news reader, a Firefox extension. Great little application. Hat tip to Josh for Cocoalicious.
