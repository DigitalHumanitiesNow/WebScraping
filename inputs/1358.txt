Madness. Update:  Mark June 1st on your calendars folks!Â https://unhangout.media.mit.edu/event/archaeogaming This is probably madness, but what the hell. Given the interest this past week in the intersection(s) of archaeology and gaming that seemed to be happening across various blogs & across the twittersphere, it occurred to me that this was a really good opportunity for me to learn how to throw a virtual unconference. (Wasn’t that everyone’s first thought?) So, in order to get a sense of what people might be interested in talking about, I cooked up an ‘all our ideas’ voting page which can be found here. It presents you with pairs of ideas, and you simply click on the idea you like better in any given pair. Don’t like the ideas at all? You can add your own, no registration required. Now, to host the unconference, I’m thinking the MIT ‘unhangout’ is the way to do it. I’ve never used it, but I like the look of it, and I think it’ll be useful for my teaching next year, so again, a good opportunity. Anyway, it allows for breakout rooms via some clever coding on top of the regular google hangout. The video explains more. https://player.vimeo.com/video/90475288 I’ll leave the ‘all our ideas’ page running for a few more days. When I’ve settled on a day & time (probably this month, likely a monday or tuesday) I’ll update this post. All welcome.
