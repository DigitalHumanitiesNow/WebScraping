Cognitive computing extends the range of knowledgeÂ tasks that can be performed by computers and humans. It is characterized by the following: Life-world data. Operates on data that is large, varied, complex and dynamic, the stuff of daily human life. Natural questions. A question is more than a keywordÂ query. A question embodies unstructured meaning. ItÂ may be asked in natural language. A dialog allows for refinement of questions. Reading and understanding. Computers already know how to do math. Cognitive computing provides the ability to read. Reading includesÂ understanding context, nuance, and meaning. Analytics. Understanding is extended with statistics and reasoning.Â The system finds patterns and structures. It considers alternatives and chooses a best answer. Answers are structured and ordered. An answer is an “assembly,” a wiki-type summary, or a visualization such as a knowledge graph. It oftenÂ includes references to additional information. Cognitive computing is not artificial intelligence. Solutions are characterized by a partnership with humans: Taught rather than just programmed. Cognitive systems “borrow” from human intelligence. Computers use resources compiled from human knowledge and language. Learn from human interaction. A knowledge base is improved by feedback from humans. Feedback is ideally implicit in an interaction, or it may be explicit, e.g., thumbs up or down.
