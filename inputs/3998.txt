The First Draft is relatively new in the small world of digital humanities podcasts. Itâs hosted by some of my favorite DH people: Elijah Meeks, Jason Heppler, and Paul Zenke. I havenât made it through the entire back catalog, but Iâve enjoyed their close-to-the-metal discussions of building in the digital humanities. With their most recent episode titled âTableau is Excel for 2014,â it seems like they are trolling me personally.
