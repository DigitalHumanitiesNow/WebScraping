I’m facilitating a working group at the National Council on Public History’s 2014 meeting about “Sustaining Digital Public History.” We’ve got a good group and I’m hoping we can examine a nice range of sustainability questions.  I’ve started the case study flow with a post on the September 11 Digital Archive. All are welcome to join the conversation through the website and at the conference in Monterey.
