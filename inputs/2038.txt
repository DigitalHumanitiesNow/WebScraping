HdtDep is a treebank and search engine based on the first book of Herodotus’         Histories. The structure of the sentences has been parsed applying a modified version of Mel’čuk’s         dependency syntax, and has been encoded in an XML database. The search engine allows searching         for precise dependency patterns involving specific grammatical categories or lexemes in exact         sequences, and can easily be programmed through a user friendly graphic interface. This tool is         especially designed for classicists and linguists investigating Greek word order—hence the choice of         Herodotus’ prose as linguistic material—but can also be useful for teachers and language learners.
