I just submitted a revision of my paper “From Traces to Collective Memory: Databases and the Development of the Field of Electronic Literature”Â —Â my keynote talk for last year’s âThe Digital Subject: Questioning Hypermnesia” conference at Paris 8 university. The essay considers how trivia and traces and databases are used to reconstruct memory and to develop the basis of fields, first by considering Paul Auster’s Winter Journal and D.T. Max’s Every Ghost Story is a Love Story, and then by considering the process of developing the ELMCIP Electronic Literature Knowledge Base. The essay will be translated into French and published bilingually in âThe Digital Subject: Questioning Hypermnesia” to be published by by Les Presses du RÃ©el in 2014.
