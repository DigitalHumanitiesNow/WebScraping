I am very flattered by the number of congratulations Iâve received on and offline for the publication of my book, Reading Machines: Toward an Algorithmic Criticism. (University of Illinois Press).  Many have even pre-ordered it, and I fully intend to reimburse anyone who does that by buying them beer.  But I must point out that the book is not actually out.  When I try to click through and order a copy, it tells me that it wonât be available until the first week of December.  I donât know how accurate that is (itâs the first time Iâve read an actual release date).  I can say that the book is very close to being ready for the printer.  But now that it has been revealed, I want to take this opportunity to point out how amazing the cover is.  I didnât have any brilliant suggestions to make about cover art (Iâm kind of a text guy), and so I just left it to the design department at Illinois.  They hired a brilliant designer named Alex de Armond (http://www.alexdearmond.com/) who created the image by layering blank pages from Google Books, thus creating a texture somewhat like the layers of an onion skin.  The thumb, of course, is one of the infamous artifacts from the Google Books scanning process.  I am so very, very glad that I left this decision to others.  I think itâs fantastic.  And really, why not judge a book by its cover?
