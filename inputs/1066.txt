Now that the month of March is over, our student poster exhibit in the Mayor’s Neighborhood Gallery has come down in order to make room for another exhibit; however, our companion exhibit of Curley-related projects and artifacts will remain on display through the end of April!Â  This exhibit can be found in the glass display case in the lobby / reception area of the Mayorâs office, located on the 5th floor of City Hall. From City Hall Plaza or Congress St. entrances, take South Elevators to the 5th floor, follow signs to Mayorâs Office.
