http://www.psychologyinaction.org/2011/11/10/organizing-research-with-mendeley-and-dropbox/ “Students and researchers of all stripes need to organize their research, and there are a number of different tools out there to help them.Â  As I was about to attend graduate school, I wanted to iron out a system before things spiraled out of control and into disarray.Â  I think Iâve managed to do that now, and the approach Iâve settled on has some very nice benefits: Itâs free Itâs platform-independent It syncs across multiple computers/devices It offers easy ways to collaborate and share research It allows you to pick and choose which applications and interfaces you prefer   The stars of this show are the Mendeley desktop app and Dropbox.Â  Mendeley offers both a desktop application and an online service that combines a pretty awesome reference manager (the app) with online syncing, backup and social/collaborative tools to boot.Â  Mendeley lets you browse all of your research articles, sorted by title, author, journal, year, or however you like.Â  It also lets you search within all of them, sort them into groups, or apply tags to them so that you can more easily find them (what was that paper I read 6 months ago?).Â  Mendeleyâs niftiest feature may be its ability to automatically pull up citation data for an article, either by scanning the pdf itself or by checking searching an online database based on title.Â  Itâs not perfect, but Iâd say it bats around .800.Â  When it comes time to cite your references, Mendeley integrates with and supports BibTex, CiteULike and Zotero.” — Derek   This is a great idea! IMO all grad students should (1) keep track of articles, (2) use a reference manager, and (3) make use of an online cloud storage system like Dropbox.
