 I’m a bit of a classification nut. It comes from my Dutch heritage — those Dutchies are always trying to be efficient with their tiny bits of land. It’s why I’m drawn to library science too. I think a lot about the way I organize computer files and emails into folders. It provides insight into the way all classification works, and of course ties into my Lila project. I’d really like to hear about your own practices. Here’s mine: Start with a root folder. When an activity starts, I put a bunch of files into a root folder (e.g., a Windows directory or a Gmail label). Sort files by subject or date. As the files start to pile up in a folder, I find stuff by sorting filesÂ by subject or date using application sorting functions (e.g., Windows Explorer). Group files into folders by subject.Â When there are a lot of files in a folder, I group files into different folders. The subject classification is low level, e.g, Activity 1, Activity 2.Â Activities that are expire are usually grouped together into an ‘archive’ folder. Â Develop a model.Â Over time the folder and file structure can get complex, making Â it hard to find stuff. I often resort to search tools. What helps is developing a model that reflects my work. E.g., Client 1, Client 2. Different levels correspond to my workflow, E.g., 1. Discovery, 2. Scoping, 3. Estimation, etc. The model is really a taxonomy, an information architecture. I can use the same pattern for each new activity. Classification always requires tinkering. I’ve been slowly improving the way I organize files into folders for as long as I’ve been working. Some patterns get reused over time, others get improved. Tinkering never ends. (I will discussÂ the use of tagging later. Frankly, I find manual tagging hopeless.)
