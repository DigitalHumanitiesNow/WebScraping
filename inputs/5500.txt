Still looking for somewhere to unwind in 2015? Why not do a conference â city trip combo?Transportation costs are on the house! If your project/grant covers them of course, otherwise donât bother â just go on a proper vacation. And donât start that âI donât have time for vacationâ crap. Bullshit. Cut your Twitter and Tinder time in half and youâve already got three weeks to spare.Challenge the Past/Diversify the Future: A Critical Approach to Visual and Multi-SensoryRepresentations for History and Culture in Gothenburg (March 19-21 2015)Multi-sensory representations?! I donât think I want to know what an average Egyptian DIY-mud-and-poo-brick house smelt like. Or taste the notorious Roman fish gut seasoning. But thereâs more brainy stuff to explore here. Posh UK-based Ninja is part of a panel that will discuss error and subjectivity in our sources. Her presentation will focus on spaghetti monsters of course. Sheâs going to talk about the instinctivity (Iâm making up words again, right?) of layouts and the problem of statictivity (maybe I should start my own dictionary) of networks and how to deal with time lapse. And thereâs the Volvo museum. Now whoâd wanna miss out on that?!Computer Applicationsand Quantitative Methods in Archaeology in Siena (March 30 â April 3 2015)This yearâs Woodstock for archaeologists who like to go digital is held in Siena.

Nothing to see there, but fortunately the workshops seem interesting enough to consider spending the whole three days indoors. Not only will there be sessions on SNA (Posh Ninjaâs heading over there too!), but you can also learn how to work with Python â an essential programming tool for any serious Digital Humanist!XXXV Sunbelt 2015in Brighton (June 23-28 2015)Brighton (UK) has been bombarded to SNA Mekka 2015.

Crossing the channel on your way? Dover, Canterbury and Hastings are just a few roundabouts away! Just remember to GO LEFT!DH2015 in Sydney (June 29 â July 3 2015)Got some excess grant money or a very rich and demented auntie? Why not sign up?! You can ogle at the Opera House during a Harbor luncheon cruise, flex your abs on Bondi Beach, or tour the Blue Mountains. Heck, while youâve flown all this way out, why not pack up that tent, call shotgun in that rental car and explore the rest of New South Wales? In the meantime, your beloved Data Ninjas are really really really busy, cuz we've got this Science Slam thingy coming up soon. We'll keep you posted on how that turns out. And after that, new networks. Promised.
