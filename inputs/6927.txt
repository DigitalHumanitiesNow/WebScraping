Tim Burke, who participated in the open peer review last fall, recently posted his reflections about the state of digital humanities at large, and our edited volume in particular: The third problem, and the one I think is most pertinent to Writing History in a Digital Age, is that stressing out too much about opposition often leads you to miss out on allies who substantively agree with everything you have to say but who work on a completely different subject, in a different medium, or in a different context. So, for example, the digital humanists who believe strongly in the potential of information technology to commingle public, âamateurâ and scholarly productions of history, or to circulate scholarly knowledge in new ways, shouldnât overlook other clusters of scholars whoâve been laboring to accomplish the same things without digital technologies. See comments from readers (including one of our contributors, Sherman Dorn) at Tim’s blog, Easily Distracted.
