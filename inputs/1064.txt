 The images above (courtesy of Twilk) are some of the @diggingdh followers from Twitter. We know from communicating and collaborating with you that social media plays an enormous role in your lives, and we’re eager to hear all about it! Members of the DiggingDH team (namely Kim Martin, and Ryan Hunt) will be attending MLA 2014 in Chicago this coming week. While we are there, we are hoping to talk to 25 conference attendees about the role of social media in their working lives, and how others have influenced their opinions of the digital humanities. The interviews take about 25 minutes, and we will be onsite at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel to conduct them. You can sign up for a time that suits you HERE. Of course, if you would like to meet elsewhere, or at times other than those listed in the sign up sheet below, please email us at diggingdh@gmail.com or send us a tweet at @diggingdh and we’ll do our best to meet your needs. Looking forward to meeting many of you in person for the first time, and to learning more about the social side of the digital humanities.
