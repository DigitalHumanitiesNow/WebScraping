The hardest part of doing better on the internet (at least for me, and in my experience for many others) is following these rules. I don’t always get there, but I’m always trying. 1: You could always be wrong. 2: Remember that people criticizing a group of which you are a member are not criticizing you personally. 3: Do not deploy knee-jerk defenses of organizations or groups you enjoy, people can defend themselves until you do the research. Sometimes they can continue to defend themselves after you’ve done the research. 3b: The following can almost always defend themselves and are likely not worthy of you excusing them. Consider carefully before penning defenses of these folks: – Multi-million dollar corporations – Government officials – Societies of significant size – High profile people acting in insulting ways. – Groups in which you are a member of a minority when the majority is acting badly.Â Everyone already understands it’s Not All … whatever. – Groups in which you are a member of a silent majority and the minority is acting badly. If you’re silent about them acting badly, you are in the wrong, or at least not right. 4:Â When listening to or reading others, believe their experiences and statements first, doing research where you have doubts second. 5: Inaccuracies donât imply conspiracy or attack in every situation. Nor do some inaccuracies in a larger work invalidate the whole. 6: All personal experiences have validity, even if their experience of something is different than yours. 6b:Â You may disagree with their conclusions, but the experiences happened. 6c: No one knows your context, you don’t know anyone else’s context unless they outline it explicitly. Act accordingly. 7: Always follow the principle of least harm. If there are two options and one could potentially hurt someoneâs feelings and the other doesn’t, and both get your point across, use the one that isn’t harmful. 8: Criticism of your speech or work, no matter how snarky, is not an attack. Don’t take it personally. 8b: Criticism of your work, or others’, does not take away your ‘free speech’. Nor does moderation by others. Nor does others refusing to amplify you. 9: It’s never ‘well, that’s the way it is’. Positive change comes from challenging the status quo. 9b: People who challenge the status quo are not attacking you for not doing so. 9c: People who don’t challenge the status quo are not explicitly attacking you for doing so. 9d: Only you are responsible for your attempt to challenge ‘how it is’ and you should encourage, though not require, others to do so. 10: It doesn’t have to be about you, your group, your interest or your beliefs. Not everything is about you. 10b: A conversation that has nothing about you need not also cover you or your particular group. People not talking about you are not automatically inviting you to add on a conversation about you. 10c: Talking about ‘not you’ or yours is not a statement that no one should talk about you or yours, nor is it an attack on you or your interests. 11: Whenever possible, amplify other voices instead of paraphrasing, repossessing, or repeating. 12:Â Everyone deserves the benefit of doubt. Every person deserves your respect of them as a person. Extra(obvious) rule: treat others as you would wish to be treated.  Jumping to conclusions, from The Phantom Tollbooth.
