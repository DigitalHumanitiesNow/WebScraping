When snow days, conferences, or other disruptions occur, instructional continuity plans can be used to keep courses and students on track. This TLISI session, presented on Monday, May 18, included a panel of instructors who gathered to discuss how they have used technology to implement and enhance instructional continuity. Panelists described a wide range of useful technologies such as Skype, screen-sharing, Zoom, Echo360, Blackboard, and Google Docs and shared experiences, tips and tricks from their own classrooms. Tania Gentic (Spanish and Portuguese) described how she used Google Hangouts to hold her class during a snow day. She explained that it was remarkably easy to set up with a small group of 10 students. One advantage to Google Hangouts is the intimate environment with everyone visible on the screen. Gentic felt that her Google Hangout courses were some of the best course she had all semester. Patricia OâConnor (English) skyped in to the panel demonstrating the various applications she uses during her instructional continuity classes. OâConnor used a chat session in addition to Zoom video chatting to hold large classes with 24 students. Screen-sharing allowed her to show You-Tube videos, documents, and other materials during the class. In Rolando Arrietaâs (School of Continuing Studies) course, students met with IT services beforehand to prep their Â computers and applications for a future canceled class. Due to his forward thinking, there were no technological issues during the remotely held course. Arrieta warns that the technology does take time to get used to, especially when bandwidth usage interrupts audio and video feeds. Jennifer Lubkin (English as a Foreign Language) has always used instructional continuity to avoid gaps in her studentsâ language learning. She explained that instructional continuity should be seen as an opportunity to try new things and asked, âwhat does technology bring to our classes that we couldnât do otherwise?” Instead of trying to recreate the classroom, she tries to createÂ something new using technology. Jason Tilan (Nursing) echoed this sentiment by explaining how important it is to see studentâs faces in the âBrady Bunchâ style video feed. In this format, students can watch their own emotions and visibly see their reactions to course content. Additionally, a professor can see clearly how engaged students are in the material which is more difficult in large classes. Tips for instructional continuity from the panelists: Check your technology set-up before a class is canceled. IT services are availableÂ to help professors and students prepare their computers and applications for use during instructional continuity. Elect a student to monitor a chat session along with the video. This way, the instructor is free to monitor discussion. Warn students that they will be on video if necessary. Prepare students that may have less experience with the instructional continuity technologies due to cultural or linguistic differences. This technology could be used for other purposes other than missed classes: team meetings, office hours, and faculty meetings are just some of the many opportunities where instructors might implement instructional continuity.
