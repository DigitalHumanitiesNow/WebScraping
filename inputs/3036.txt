Christmas is doing a little something extra for someone. – Charles Schulz Itâs December 16, 1913 and, as always, Iâve left my Christmas shopping until the very last minute. Iâve spent this morning creating a list of my family of book-lovers and searching the Eatonâs Catalog to find the perfect gifts. I think perhaps I will cut out the images of these books and paste them into the cards for my family so they might know that they will be receiving these books sometime in February. If only there was a quicker method of receiving these books, like a magic screen I could look at and just make the pages of these books appearâ¦ Whoa. What was that? And what the H*#% am I wearing? Nevermind that! The Eatonâs 1913 catalog has transformed itself into just the screen I was thinking about, and it has a series of buttons attached to it which mirror the QWERTY typewriters Iâve heard so much about! This machine is telling me that its now December 16th, 2011â¦ and as my new-age capacity to deal with technology sets in, all I can hear in my head is âGoogle itâ¦ Google itâ¦ Google it.â For Dad Mortars, plasters, stuccos, artificial marbles, concretes, portland cements and compositions … http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924003641333#page/n485/mode/2up Catalog #34-272 Author: Fred T. Hodgson Place: Chicago Year: 1906 Found this full text online at the Internet Archive’s Open Library. Although it is the same book, I believe the 300 page cloth-bound edition that appears in the catalog might be a later edition than the one available online. For Mum The White House Cook Book http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13923/13923-h/13923-h.htm#Page_376 Catalog # 34-195 Author: Mrs. F.L. Gillette Place: New York Year: 1887 The best online version of this book I could find was part of the Project Gutenberg project. The book has been redesigned as one long script, but the chapters are hyper-linked and the text is keyword searchable. Also included are scans of the original, showing various cuts of meat and photos of all of the First-Ladies. For Edith and Andrew What a Young Wife Ought to Know/What a Young Husband Ought to Know http://openlibrary.org/books/OL6999918M/What_a_young_wife_ought_to_know Catalog # 34-180 Author: Emma F. Angell Drake Place: Philadelphia Year: 1908 http://www.archive.org/stream/whatayounghusba00stalgoog#page/n8/mode/2up Catalog # 34-181 Author: Sylvanus Stall Place: Philadelphia Year: 1907 These two books were both found using Google, and the search led me directly to the Internet Archive. What’s great about this site is that it allows you to download the book in a series of formats (PDF, plain text, daisy, Epub) or to simply read the book online. It also provides a good deal of information about where else the book can be found online, and about the physical document itself, so you can get exactly the gift you want to give! For Thomas The New Century standard Letter-Writer http://www.archive.org/stream/newcenturystanda00chamrich#page/n5/mode/2up Catalog # 34-200 Author: Alfred B. Chambers, Ph.D Place: Chicago Year: 1900 Once again, Open Library provided the best version of this book available online. Given the age of the book, I couldn’t believe what a clear set of scans were available. Reading these letters, and looking over the reasons that letters used to be deemed necessary gives one a sense of nostalgia very fitting for this time of year. I might just keep this one for myself and get Thomas a Toblerone. For Ruth Through the Looking-Glass http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=CarGlas.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=1&division=div1 Catalog # 34-352 Author: Lewis Carrol Place: London Year: 1871 There are very many copies of this book available online, but because of the ease of use of the University of Virginia’s Etext library version, and because they kept the original John Tenniel drawings, I thought this was the best version for my 13 year old sister. For Robert The Boy Scouts in the Rockies http://www.manybooks.net/titles/carterhe3235432354.html Catalog # ??? page N 286 Author: Herbert Carter Place: New York Year: 1913 Although the origin for this book is Project Gutenberg, I much preferred the layout of the ManyBooks page, which gives you information about the book, a short synopsis, an excerpt and then allows you to choose to download in one of 24 formats. What surprised me most about my search for these books in 2011 was the ease with which most of them could be found. For anyone simply wanting to read these books from times gone by, it wouldn’t take long to find most of these online. I think, however, that one going in search of a specific edition of a book might have a much harder time in their quest. Luckily for me, my family is unaware of my ability to time travel ( as was I just a short time ago) so they should enjoy their books regardless of the edition I was able to find. Now if I can only find a way to lug this machine back to 1913…
