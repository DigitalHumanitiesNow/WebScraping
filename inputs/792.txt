Several people have written to me individually to express concern that they haven’t seen me on the Internet much lately. (Thanks for getting in touch! I really appreciate it, I just haven’t had the time to respond individually.) Since January, I’ve been very busy with professional and personal matters which have taken a good deal of time and will continue to do so. But there’s some good news amid the hard work: I’m excited to announce that I’ve accepted a permanent faculty position in the history department at Florida International University in Miami, where I will be starting this fall. My position is at the rank of Instructor, but it’s an unusually-structured position– a blend of classrooom instruction and service. I’ll be teaching 2 courses per semester, focusing primarily on digital history methods. In my service capacity, I’ll be advising faculty and graduate students on digital research and analysis methods. I’ll also be working with the university library on a number of digital projects, including but not limited to: digitization of some interesting archival collections;  grantwriting to support these projects and development of digital-humanities infrastructure in the university libraries; helping out with a digital asset-management platform used by FIU’s libraries and museums; and helping to bring FIU’s digital collections into wider use within the history curriculum. This is a great faculty opportunity with an alt-ac flavor, and I’m very enthusiastic to start working with FIU’s history department and library staff. Accordingly, for the next few months, I will mostly be scarce on the Internet, as I work hard towards a dissertation defense. Think of it as a social media sabbatical. One of the few exceptions to my generally-offline spring and summer will be today and tomorrow, when I’ll  be participating in the American Antiquarian Society’s conference “Research Libraries in the Digital Age: Needs and Opportunities,â which will be on Twitter at #AAS3rdCentury. More on that later, perhaps. For now, off to Worcester!
