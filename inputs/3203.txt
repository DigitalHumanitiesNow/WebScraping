 Iâm currently speaking at the 2015 MLA on the panel “The MLA and Its Data: Remix, Reuse, and Research,â which I organized on behalf of the MLAâs Committee on Information Technology. Iâll be posting the full text of my talkââConstellations at the Convention: 10 Years of MLA Dataââshortly, but here are some links that people might want to play with in the meantime. a visualization of Mark Sampleâs list of 2015 digital humanities sessions a visualization of Mark Sampleâs list of 2014 and 2015 digital humanities sessions a visualization of the MLA Convention from 2004-2014, colored by degree of connection a visualization of the MLA Convention from 2004-2014, colored by algorithmically detected communities The latter two might take some time to load.
