I think that's one of the best linkfests in a while. Judge for yourself:A long and illustrated (by Youtube videos, of course) survey by The Next Web: Augmented reality: The past, present and future (via @yoav85)A couple of weeks ago Qualcomm held its Uplinq conference. Xconomy has a nice review of Qualcomm's AR vision and the five application categories it is trying to promote.Qualcomm's Jay Wright however thinks that AR glasses are a long way off - both due to technology challenges and adoption issues.Early bird tickets to Metaio's insideAR conference (still they are quite costly, I think :/)Artists corner:Helen Papagiannis hopes to treat phobias with a pop-up book with augmented reality extensions, full of creepy crawlies (powered by Junaio).Sander Veenhof once again checks the boundries of AR with 3D2D3D (powered by Layar). I could have tried to explain it, but would surely fail. Brian Wassom has an interesting interview with daqri's CEO, Brian Mullins on how to create a Youtube of AR content.Since Friday was Canada Day, and tomorrow is the 4th of July, let us celebrate with a double feature in this week's video. Two first person shooter games caught my eye this week, the first ShootAR has a surprisingly sleek teaser video, while the other Uwar seems a little bit more feasible, and features cool shirts (well, cool is in the eye of the beholder). Is this new generation of AR games going to heat things up?Have an excellent week!
