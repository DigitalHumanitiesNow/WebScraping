Professional Opportunities in Digital Humanities January 21, 2014 5:00-6:30 p.m. Library Instruction Room, Love Library South 110 This workshop will introduce students to conference, publication, training, and fellowship opportunities in Digital Humanities at the local, national, and international level. Participants will learn about specific opportunities available at this time–such as calls for proposals for the 2015 meetings of the American History Association and the Modern Language Association, a Programming for Humanists course from Texas A&M that can be attended via Google Hangouts, and a new project incubator for students available here at UNL–and we’ll discuss how to find out about future opportunities. The primary audience for this workshop is students–undergraduate and graduate–but the workshop is open to everyone.
