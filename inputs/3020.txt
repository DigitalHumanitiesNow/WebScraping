I have just added the following resources to the Maia Atlantis feed aggregator:title = Building Tabernaeurl = http://buildingtabernae.org/creators = Miko Flohrlicense = Nonedescription = About two years ago, I received a quarter million euro grant from the Dutch government for a  four year project on urban commercial investment in Roman Italy, and a project blog was already in the proposal. The project â Building Tabernae â started April, 2013, and is now about to enter a new phase, in which some results will start emerging, and new data will be gathered. The blog, I hope, is a way to force the scholar in charge of this project â me â to record and communicate the projectâs successes and failures, and everything else that one encounters when investigating commercial investment in Roman Italy, and to be available for discussion with specialists and non-specialists alike.feed = http://buildingtabernae.org/feed/title = Archaeology of Portus: Exploring the Lost Harbour of Ancient Romeurl = http://moocs.southampton.ac.uk/portus/creators = University of Southampton and FutureLearnlicense = Nonedescription = The University of Southampton and FutureLearn are running a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course), focusing on the archaeological work in progress at the Roman site of Portus.
