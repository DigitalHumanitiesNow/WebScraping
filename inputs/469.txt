Top among the activities I never quite feel like I get just right is grading. Grading student papers, to be exact. Hereâs the thing: Iâm perfectly comfortable giving feedback. Iâm more than happy to respond with comments, hopefully helpful comments. But, that darn gradeâwhether a number, a letter, even a check/check plusâis always the worst. We discussed assessment of essays and exams in a recent department meeting. Several (most?) of us use rubrics for grading essays. As of yesterday, I now have a helpful file with rubric examples from all my colleagues.Â We use a wide range — from narrative descriptions of what papers should include, to more detailed check-boxes with pretty specific criteria (e.g. “fewer than five spelling/grammatical issues). by Michael Fisher Since much of my studentsâ writing this semester is on their blogs, and since assessment of digital writing should include consideration of visual rhetoric, blog design, links, etc., Iâve explored two Google Chrome extensions that grab a webpage and turn it into a screen shot or PDF. Of the two, Iâve had most luck with FireShot. Once I have a PDF of a studentsâ blog post, I then add comments in Adobe Reader using the comments feature. At the end of the post, I write more in-depth comments using the writing feature. While this practice works, Iâm sure thereâs a better, more efficient way. (Before somebody suggests using an iPad, I find that I type much more slowly on an iPad keyboard, so Iâm not interested grading by iPad. Also, I know some people use iAnnotate to leave audio comments. Iâm really drawn to the personal nature of such comments that tone of voice might bring, but it has to take longer. Right?) In terms of actual feedback given to students, I try to tailor the feedback for each studentsâ context and experience. For instance, for students whom I know are dealing with vocational questions, Iâll leave questions about purpose, mission, and values. For students particularly interested in the mechanics of writing, Iâll try to make more notes about matters of grammar, syntax, and diction. My classes are small enough that I can get away with this non-rubric-driven approach to grading, and I certainly recognize that as a huge privilege. After I send a round of papers back to students with comments, I always wonder: now what? What happens to those comments? How many students actually read the comments? If they are read, how many and what sort of comments help change studentsâ future practice? Do the sometimes snarky, sometimes emoticony, sometimes very serious comments I leave, elicit their own set of comments in student circles? This sentiment reminds me, somewhat at least, of howÂ I sometimes feel after preaching a sermon, especially a sermon with lots of questions and/or clear areas for response. In preaching, however, the point of the hearers’ response is not necessarily to engage in conversation with the preacher, but to engage in a way of life. I suppose that’s not dissimilar to my hope, as a professor, when I grade. While I’d love to be in further conversation with the student, the ultimate end is not a conversation about a specific paper. Instead, I’m hoping to teach — and push students to — wise, thoughtful engagement in the world. And that, my friends, is hard to grade.
