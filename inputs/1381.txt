In case you haven't already seen it, the newest edition of Common-Place is up. A few good articles are below:  "History Made Me Liberal" by Jeffrey L. Pasley -- My favorite lines: "What is the world coming to when political scientists start rating presidents? Next the historians will start telling the kids that the Indians were here first or something." "Legal History and the Material Culture of the Law" by Michael Hoeflich -- A review of Martha J. McNamara's From Tavern to Courthouse: Architecture & Ritual in American Law, 1685-1860. "Family Values: Lessons in Material Culture" by Martha Brogan -- A great article about discovery and family history.
