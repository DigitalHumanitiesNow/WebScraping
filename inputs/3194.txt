Digital pedagogy is not a path through the woods. Itâ€™s a compass (one that often takes several people working in concert to use). And in the next 10 years, digital pedagogy will become (and already is to an extent) synonymous with pedagogy. We do not, after all, talk about chalkboard pedagogy, even though the chalkboard is one of the most advanced and revolutionary educational tools. Digital pedagogy is also becoming, for me, synonymous with critical pedagogy, given the degree to which the digital can function both as a tool for and an obstacle to liberation. Digital pedagogy demands that we rethink power relations between students and teachers -- demands we create more collaborative and less hierarchical spaces for learning -- lest we use computers to replicate the vestigial structures of industrial-era education.
