Sarah Manekin invited Jack Dougherty and others to contribute to a workshop on âResearching, Writing and Publishing History in the Digital Ageâ for graduate students in the Department of History, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia on Friday, November 16th, 2012. This workshop builds on a prior discussion we organized at the History of Education Society meeting in 2010, which served as a pilot forÂ Writing History in the Digital Age. Jack’s task is to explain the rapidly-changing world of digital book publishing for scholars in six minutes. Here’s a link to his talking points.
