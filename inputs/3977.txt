Kicking off the 14th session of TLISI, plenary speaker Jeff Selingo, author of New York Times best selling College (Un)Bound: The Future of Higher Education and What It Means for Students, laid out some of the tough questions facing higher education today. Ranging from the rise of non-traditional students to the crush of increasing financial need, Jeff shared data and insights about the environment that universities are trying to innovate within. A journalist by training, Jeff spoke to the parallels between the changes he has seen in the newspaper and journalism industry of higher education, noting that âwe tend to overestimate the speed of change but underestimate the depth of change.â Jeff argued that while online education wonât be replacing in-person education overnight and universities actually have much greater resilience than many other institutions, changes in student needs and new opportunities in technology and skills-based education will drive shifts that we cannot even expect or anticipate today. Among the signs of these coming changes, Jeff highlighted the growing potential of non-traditional pathways through education. Citing stats that question the âHollywoodâ understanding of college as a continuous, 4-year experience that happens at 18 years-old is an increasing minority, Jeff argued that the âoverstuffed bachelorâs degreeâ needs to be redesigned to accommodate multiple kinds of demands from many different kinds of students. He highlighted five alternative types of student that arenât the traditional, Hollywood undergraduate, including âcoming of ageâ students who treat college as a maturing experience and âindustry switchersâ coming back to the university to re-educate and re-skill over the course of their lifetime. Jeff cited two examples of alternative models emerging in the face of growing demand for experience and skills-based learning over the course of a lifetime. The first of these is the explosion of lean, small-burst educational experience sought during the early 20s or in the development of a career. Leaders in this space include online learning sources like Lynda and Codecademy, but also in-person learning through organizations like General Assembly. Focused on acquiring skill sets in coding and other areas that may not have been offered or seen as important when students were attending college, Jeff suggested that many students would be excited to gain these kinds of skills through ongoing or small-burst courses at institutions like Georgetown, but they simply arenât being offered. Another example Jeff posed was that of the âOpen Loop Universityâ, one alternative model of higher education developed by Stanford Universityâs @Stanford University project. In this model, upon enrollment, a student would receive âsix years of access to residential learning opportunities to distribute across their lives as they saw fit.â This alternative model is meant to address the growing need for students to âlearn, un-learn and re-learn over the course of a lifetime,â as Jeff described it. As a final guiding note, Jeff suggested that in order to maintain clarity of purpose while innovating, universities must define the value of your degree, the value of the undergrad experienceâ and to find elements of undergrad experience that you can define, measure, and tell stories around. To do this most effectively, universities need to build alliances with each other, rather than competing against each other via college ranking, increasingly outdated measures of success that donât take into account the growing diversity of needs of students. CNDLS would like to thank Jeff for spending time with us during TLISI and leading us in aÂ thought-provoking opening plenary.
