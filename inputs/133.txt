By Christabelle Sethna Very few Canadians know that the RCMP conducted surveillance of the Vancouver Womenâs Caucus (VWC) and its Abortion Caravan.[1] This discovery is just one outcome of research undertaken with Dr. Steve Hewitt. We worked with hundreds of pages of declassified RCMP files, using surveillance reports (many of which are redacted) as well as appended open source material. The 1969 Criminal Code reforms coincided with the emergence of womenâs liberation groups like the VWC. These groups, made up mainly of young, white women, were part of the 1960s New Left ferment that included opposition to the Vietnam War and support for womenâs rights, the student movement, Black Power and Red Power and anti-imperialism.[2] Before launching the Caravan, some VWC members set up an abortion referral service that ferried pregnant women to doctors willing to perform underground abortions. Because this action was technically illegal under the new abortion law, we speculated that the RCMP, responsible for investigating criminal activity as well as threats to national security, was spying on the women to gather evidence of domestic law breaking. However, it was not the VWCâs possible criminal activity that attracted the RCMPâs attention. Rather, the Mountiesâ Security Service branch spied on the VWC because the organizationâs left-leaning politics were deemed threatening to national security. Hewittâs own research has illustrated that the Security Service had a long history of spying on Old Left political activism due to the fear of Communist infiltration.[3] It now extended that same surveillance net over New Left organizations, including womenâs liberation. Spying on womenâs liberation groups posed a challenge to an all-male (until 1974) and all-white police force accustomed to dealing with male-led protest. Even though the Security Service acknowledged that these groups were invested in gender equality, it was suspicious of the possible relationship between Trotskyist-inspired organizations and womenâs liberation. Using a combination of direct observation, media coverage, print literature and male and female informants, the Mounties learned of the VWCâs plans for the Abortion Caravan, acquired its itinerary and actively tracked its journey to Ottawa. The Caravan had echoes of the On to Ottawa trek of 1935. Trekkers were said to be Communists and their leaders were arrested. To add fodder to the RCMPâs suspicions, the lead Caravan vehicle originally bore the slogan âSmash Capitalismâ alongside another, âAbortion is our Right!â The Caravaners soon removed the first slogan because they did not want to distract the Canadian public from their main focus on abortion. The Security Service was aware that the VWC had demanded a meeting with high-ranking federal politicians, including Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, to discuss their opposition to the new abortion law, and had threatened the government with a declaration of war. Still, the local police and RCMP officers on the ground were caught off guard by the Caravanersâ subsequent actions. When a large group of angry Caravaners and supporters marched to the Prime Ministerâs residence on 9 May, the crush of women overwhelmed the half dozen policemen guarding the gate. Importantly, the vacationing Trudeau and the RCMP brass agreed that the women had to leave on their own as the prospect of burly male officers dragging protesting women off the premises would play badly in the media, especially so soon after the debacle at Kent State. Two days later, the RCMP was caught unawares yet again when a small group of Caravaners entered the visitorsâ galleries in the House of Commons using forged passes, chained themselves to the seats, and began chanting slogans demanding access to abortion services. The RCMPâs unpreparedness on both occasions may have had to do with a lack of communication among various local security forces. More likely, the Security Branch may not have taken the womenâs demands seriously despite the wealth of surveillance files it generated on the VWC and the Caravan. Therefore, it is worth considering which variables might have figured into the Security Serviceâs threat assessment of womenâs liberation activists. Gender was a key variable but so too were the womenâs whiteness and relative youth. These variables may have made it easier for the RCMP to underestimate the Caravanersâ steadfast determination to take direct action against the abortion law. Conversely, they may also have worked in the womenâs favour, catching the RCMP on the back foot and resulting in two historic security breaches at the highest levels of the Canadian government.
