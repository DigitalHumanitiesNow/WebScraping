If you're interested in what I have to say about Guardians of the Galaxy, I was a guest on Graphic Policy Radio radio talking about it last night. I made a number of claims about the film, foremost among them its indebtedness to mid-period Marx Brothers films. I also said quite about something I kept calling "old-school sci-fi wonder" -- though I have no idea why I became so wedded to that phrase -- and Parks and Rec, because anytime I have the opportunity to discuss Parks and Rec, I will. UPDATE: I forgot many of the interesting tangents we went on, e.g. What would a science fiction film that wasn't anthropocentric actually look like, and would it ever get made? (For example, can you imagine a film version of an Iain M. Banks novel?) AND ALSO: All of the "Bert Macklin, FBI" stuff on Parks and Rec -- his deep commitment to his flights of fancy -- always reminded me of what Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes would've grown up to be like, so Guardians of the Galaxy struck me like a "Spaceman Spiff" serial.
