On March 26, 2015, Indiana Governor Mike Pence signed SB101. Known as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), its supporters argued that it was meant to protect religious freedom. However, it is part of nationwide push by conservative state legislators to legalize religious based discrimination — part of an effortÂ to curb the rights of women, LGBTQI individuals, and others. Indiana’s RFRA givesÂ business owners the right toÂ refuse service toÂ any individual based on any vague set of religious principles: “exercise of religion” includes any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief Consequently, using religious justifications as a mask for bigotry, a rental property owner could refuse to rent to a married couple because ofÂ their sexual orientation. Indiana’s RFRA statesÂ that governments cannot “substantially burden” an individual’s exercise of free religion. When applied, this means that a police officer couldÂ refuse to serve at an event due to religious objections — an instance of which happened in Oklahoma in 2011. Moreover Section 2 of Indiana’sÂ RFRA takes aim at local anti-discrimination legislation, making any city’sÂ anti-discrimination legislation null and void if an individual claims religious exception: A governmental entity, statute, ordinance, resolution, executive or administrative order, regulation, custom or usage may not be construed to be exempt from the application of this chapter unless a state statute expressly exempts the statute, ordinance, resolution, executive or administrative order, regulation, custom, or usage from the application of this chapter by citation to this chapter. In aÂ state university system, one wonders what the effects might be. Could a student refuse to take an examination if the topic contradicted his or her religious principles? Could a professor refuse to teach a student whose opinions offended his or her religious beliefs? The vague wording of Indiana’s RFRA is troubling and will likely generate expensive and unnecessary lawsuits which test the limits of theÂ legislation. It has already resulted in a call for boycotts of Indiana businesses and the withdrawal of investment. Until this legislationÂ is overturned,Â itÂ will likelyÂ encourage discriminatory practices, fueled by the moral panicÂ ofÂ fundamentalists, the reactionary sentiments of the far right wing, and the prejudice ofÂ bigots. None of this is news. None of thisÂ was news when the Indiana General Assembly voted on the bill or when the governor signed it. Consequently, they are responsible forÂ both its intended and its unintended consequences. Voters should keep this in mindÂ the next timeÂ they head to the polls.
