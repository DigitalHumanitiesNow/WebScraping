I occupy Study 30 at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences.  I requested it based on the recommendation of my friend Fred Turner, who had enjoyed it a couple years back and who said it doesn’t get too hot.  Which it doesn’t.

Study 30, Center for the Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, was occupied by Thomas S. Kuhn during the 1958-59 academic year.  He was working on the manuscript that would become The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.
