As a new semester is about to begin academics are busily putting finishing touches on their course syllabi. Here at the University of Maryland there has been sustained interest over the past few months in integrating discussion and thinking about the recent events in Ferguson, and subsequent #BlackLivesMatter movement into our classes. Look for news about planned teach-ins and events like ours in the coming weeks. If you are interested in finding Ferguson and #BlackLivesMatter resources to use in your coursework one place to look is the #FergusonSyllabus hashtag on Twitter. Marcia Chatelain, a history professor at Georgetown University and a University of MissouriâColumbia alumna, started this hashtag with this tweet back in August of 2014: #FergusonSyllabus: "Black in Blue: African-American Police Officers and Racism," @JamesLoewen, @TouchstoneBooks — Dr. Marcia Chatelain (@DrMChatelain) August 17, 2014 You can listen to an interview with Chatelain from Saint-Louis Public Radio soon conducted just a few days after this tweet. Since then there have been over 8,000 tweets with the #FergusonSyllabus hashtag. Chatelain wrote a post about her favorite suggested resources, and you can find other lists, such as this Google Doc from Daniel Krutka, a Professor of Education at Texas Woman’s University.  Here at MITH we have a collection of these tweets between August 17th 2014 and January 7th, 2015. We have done some rudimentary analysis that we thought we would share here. If you have ideas for things to do with this collection please let us know.
