By Joseph Fletcher, Project Manager As part of the fourth phase of the William Blake Archiveâs development, sponsored by the NEH, we have acquired a multitude of high-resolution digital images of works from 29 institutions. Some of these works are already published in the Archive, and the rest are at various stages in our publication workflow. They are listed below beneath their holding institutions.
