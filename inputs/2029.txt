Can statistically significant patterns be detected in Late Bronze Age Aegean balance weights made of lead? How should we approach the question of what type of a design system the fifth-century BC Greek architects used for Doric temples? Is it possible to say whether one of the several modern interpretations is more likely than another? Kendall's quantum modelling and Monte Carlo computer simulations may help in finding the answers.
