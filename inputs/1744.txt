 In the digital humanities, we often talk about how we can use technology and big data to accomplish what Franco Moretti calls âdistant readingâ of literary, historical, and artistic texts. But Wyn Kelley uses Annotation Studio, our web-based, collaborative annotation application, to engage her students in close reading and writing. (source)   Over the last few months, my lab, HyperStudio, has been hard at work on our collaborative digital annotation tool. I’m currently working with a few colleagues to assess the use of Annotation Studio in undergraduate classrooms at MIT. We’ve discovered that educators and students alike use the tool in really diverse and unexpected ways. I edited the video above of the wonderful Wyn Kelley describing some of her strategies to get students to read closely and develop their writing skills. You can also check out the companion blog post I wrote on HyperStudio’s website.Â
