 TheÂ 2014 Restaurant Executive SummitÂ will be held on November 3 – 5, 2014 at the Ritz-Carlton in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. The theme of the event is “How toÂ Feed Consumers with a #Digital @ppetite” I will speak about the ways that restaurants and dining experiences are discussed in social media. Â I will show network maps that visualize the relationships among people who talk about restaurants created with the free and open NodeXL social media network analysis and visualization application. Here are some recent NodeXL social media network maps for mentions of major chain restaurants featured in the NodeXL Graph Gallery:DunkinDonuts McDonalds Chipotle @olivegarden These maps illustrate the shape of the crowd that gathers around the names of major chain restaurants. Â A few Twitter user accountsÂ occupy key positions in these network crowds, these are the influential voices that are repeated widely by others. Closer inspection (click through for details) reveals smaller groups or clusters which form as a smaller set of people interact with one another more than with the larger population. Â These groups have distinct topics of interest which are summarized in the content report associated with each visualization. The network and content report can reveal the topics of interest to various groups in the discussion as well as the key people within each group.
