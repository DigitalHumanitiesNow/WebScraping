Hi all — as the new THATCamp Coordinator, I’m busily converting thatcamp.org from a site dedicated to the THATCamps held at the Center for History and New Media to a site about the global THATCamp movement, with help for organizers, participants, and lemurs. Please pardon our dust as URLs change at my whim, content appears and disappears with the tides, and information architects everywhere have a collective seizure.
