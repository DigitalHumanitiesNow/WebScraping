New Plugins The Omeka team is very happy to announce the release of two new plugins: Omeka API Import and CSS Editor. Omeka Api Import allows you to import content from one Omeka site into another using Omekaâ€™s API (the origin Omeka site must be at version 2.1 or higher to have the API). Items and files, collections, and more data can be duplicated from one site into another and updated periodically. This can be a handy solution for a simple migration to a new server, or for collecting several Omeka projects into one central Omeka site. Learn more in the documentation. CSS Editor allows site builders who are familiar with Cascading Style Sheets to customize the display of their sites without needing to directly modify theme files. A simple configuration form lets you enter your new code to override what Omeka and the theme provide. Please read the documentation for details. Updated Plugins Thanks to the feedback from our users and contributors, we also have updates for three plugins with bugfixes and improvements. Commenting now uses the same database indexing as other parts of Omeka, and allows reading gravatars over secure connections (thanks to Daniel Berthereau). It also includes better permissions handling for commenting (thanks to Daniel Lind). Simple Pages has been updated to allow much longer pages, so you can write as much as you want (thanks to Rachel Donahue for the suggestion). Geolocation includes a fix to make it interact better with Contribution, and there are display improvements in Simple Contact Form. Many thanks to all of the users and developers in ever-growing Omeka community. Keep up the good work, and keep helping us improve Omeka!
