NOTE: This post has been slightly modified and relocated to Medium under the title “Everyone has Something to Teach You” in the Advice to Graduates collection. Click the link below to read the original post.Â Â    Earlier today, Umair Haque tweeted that he wanted life advice. Haque is one of my favorite people to follow on Twitter for his honesty and his perspective. He is a critical thinker and writer, regularly contributing to Harvard Business Review, where he shares thoughts on topics ranging from economics toÂ how to create a meaningful life. As I sat, looking at Haque’s tweet and reading some of the initial responses, I remembered this morning’s Zen Habits piece, encouraging us all to write (or create, in my mind) daily, and began to share my own thoughts with Haque. The following 10 things are what came out, in five tweets (linked below). Know everyone has something to teach you. Live with intention and conviction. Remember no two people have the same experience. Reflect on your successes just as much as your failures. Even successes involve missteps. Relationships are about giving, not taking, and not giving so you can take. When you love someone, tell them. Smile everyday. Your heart, mind, and body should be exercised every day. Nothing is certain, so embrace the life youâre living, today. What and how you consume (food, ideas, energy, etc.) has a dramatic impact on what and how you produce. I recognize that every person lives a unique life and our experiences differ greatly, but for me, the above 10 “guidelines” make sense. They are a result of reflections on the conversations and experiences I have had throughout my life, and I hope they may be valuable things for you to think about as well.
