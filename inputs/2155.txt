Hi all! Iâm looking for examples of humanities or history departments that allow students to produce digital products for MA thesis and/or PhD dissertation credit. Better yet, Iâd like to find language from departmental operating papers or catalogs about accepting digital work for graduate credit. My history department at a regional masters comprehensive university is considering allowing students to produce digital products for the MA in lieu of the traditional history thesis. If possible, Iâd like to draw on examples from other departments that are already doing this rather than inventing the procedures from scratch. Any ideas or recommendations? For all you grad students out there, Iâd like to mention that this idea came from several students doing innovative projects. If you believe in innovative digital scholarship, keep pushing for it!
