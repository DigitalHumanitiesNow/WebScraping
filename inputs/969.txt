The Center for History and New Media (CHNM) has announced that we are taking applications for our summer ECHO (Exploring and Collecting History Online) workshop on the practice of digital history. The workshop is July 12-15, on George Mason University's Fairfax campus. Applications are due June 8 and can be completed at this form.  CHNM also has small ($1000) grants to help support online collecting projects that focus on the history of science, technology, and industry. Grant proposals (500 words minimum) and a C.V. are due by July 1, and should be mailed to chnm@gmu.edu with the subject line "ECHO Grant Proposal."   *[CHNM]: Center for History and New Media
