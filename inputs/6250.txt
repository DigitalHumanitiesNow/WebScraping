The Digital Scholarship blog at the British Library recently cited EDH in explaining the current mixed-reality environment of the Library itself:    …  scholarship is responding to massive changes in the world around us. Not only has the distance between online and offline all but disintegrated â just think how archaic the once ubiquitous phrases âlog-onâ and âcyberspaceâ sound today â but this lifestyle shift has had massive repercussions for academic research. As Steven Jones eloquently puts it:    The emergence of the new digital humanities isnât an isolated academic phenomenon. The institutional and disciplinary changes are part of a larger cultural shift, inside and outside the academy, a rapid cycle of emergence and convergence in technology and culture.     Just look at the British Library. Whilst we still collect, preserve and provide access to all manner of physical stuff, over the last two decades we have become a vast resource of digital objects. These data range from digitised text, sound, visual, and philatelic material, to born-digital collections of personal archives and web content: so data representing both our past and our present. Together these data are transforming research and setting the agenda for future research, with new tools and computational techniques used to wrangle, process, share and analyse  these data generating new discoveries and new understanding in the arts, humanities, and social sciences.
