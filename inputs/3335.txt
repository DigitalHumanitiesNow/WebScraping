 MARCO DONNARUMMA / XTH SENSE Goldsmiths Uni. London (UK) BIOPHYSICAL MUSIC / DEMO OCT 6TH â 4PM â MORTON 201 FREE ADMISSION  The Xth Senseâ¢ (2010-14) is a free and open biophysical technology. With it you can produce music with the sound of your body. The Xth Sense captures sounds from heart, blood and muscles and uses them to integrate the human body with a digital interactive system for sound and video production. In 2012, it was named the âworldâs most innovative new musical instrumentâ and awarded the first prize in the Margaret Guthman New Musical Instrument Competition by the Georgia Tech Center for Music Technology (US). Today, the Xth Sense is used by a steadily growing community of creatives, ranging from performing artists and musicians, to researchers in physiotherapy and prosthetics, and universities and students in diverse fields. //web: http://res.marcodonnarumma.com/projects/xth-sense //contact: prof. graham â rgraham1@stevens.edu marco_poster
