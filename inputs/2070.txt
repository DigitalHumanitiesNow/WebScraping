Creating records of inscriptions often serves multiple purposes, such as aiding         interpretation, preservation, or dissemination. Traditionally, squeezes, sketches, and photographs have         been the methods by which these representations have been made. This talk will explore the possibilities         for epigraphic study offered by non-contact 3D digitization, which enables the ability to capture, distribute,         and visualize the full geometric properties of an inscription.
