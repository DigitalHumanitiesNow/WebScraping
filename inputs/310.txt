That time of year is upon us at last! ASA is here and I can barely contain myself!Â This is one of my favorite conferences of the year, as it’s where all the badass feminists, technologists, activist/scholars, and of course frolleagues converge in one place. Yippee! I’m as excited as these guys! This year, I have the pleasure of being on a roundtableÂ about Teaching Los AngelesÂ with aÂ kickass panel of scholars and teachers to talk about a range of tactics we’ve employed in college-level coursesÂ about Los Angeles. To go along with the roundtable,Â we haveÂ put together a Scalar book with syllabi, assignments, and additional material as an accessible companion to our roundtable. This is anÂ effort to share resources with those who cannot make it to join us in person. The book is the beginning of an ongoing project, and we welcome contributions from others who would be interested in sharing assignments, exercises, activities, and syllabi from their own courses. To access the book, click on the hyperlinked cover image below.  This is very much a work in progress and we welcome feedback and engagement! In the meantime, I’ll be tweeting feminist, digital/media studies, #transformDH, and Asian American studies panels with #2014ASA. And for anyone interested in FemTechNet, HASTAC, or feminism, race, and technology, please join us and the Science and Technology Caucus for an informal gathering on Saturday at the Golden Gopher!
