You may have heard of the Humanities Matter Bus Tour. Myself, Ryan Hunt, Beth Compton, and Alex Gil ran a Kickstarter campaign to buy a bus, and tour from Virginia, up to Montreal, and across to Victoria for THE digital humanities event of the summer in beautiful Victoria BC. Along the way, we’d be recording interviews with people from all walks of life about the reasons that the humanities matter, culminating in a 3 part documentary to be released the following year. Despite tremendous support (we raised $10 000 of the $15 000 we needed, but Kickstarter is all or nothing) we didn’t meet our goal. Since then, however, numerous humanities advocacy groups have come forward with interest in the project, and we’re giving serious thought to doing the tour in Summer of 2015. This week, the team is together out at DHSI, and are looking to chat with DH folk who are interested in participating in the tour in any way. If you can organize a stop along the tour, help out with video production, have ideas of what we can do on a bus across the country, have a DH tool that needs testing by a variety of user groups… we want to talk to you! If you are feeling as crazy as us, and want to #getonthebus for some of the tour, you should definitely find one of us and let us know. Because DHSI is intense, and finding one of us might be difficult, we are going to get together for a planning session about the tour this evening (Wednesday June 4th) at 7pm (location TBA). If you’d like to join us, please tweet at @humbustour or email kim@dhmakerbus.com to let us know.
