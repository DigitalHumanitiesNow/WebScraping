Last week the Open Data product engineering team hosted a live training seminar called “Getting Started with ArcGIS Open Data.” We covered the end-user interface as well as data preperation and site layout customization for providers. You can watch a recorded version by following this link. We were asked many terrific questions during the seminar and we’ve posted all those and their answers below. If you have any other questions, please leave a comment below. Does using Open Data use the hosting organizationâs ArcGIS Online Credits? If I host services on ArcGIS Server, how should I configure them for Open Data? Can you upload and share data that has no geospatial component? Is it possible to use Open Data to share only within my organization? Can image services be shared via Open Data? What is the output projection and can it be changed? Do we need to re-project our services to Web Mercator before publishing? Should I re-project my data to Web Mercator before publishing in Open Data? Can one organization have multiple Open Data sites? Is there a site gallery that shows existing Open Data sites? Are the site widgets designed with accessibility in mind? Do you integrate with other platforms like CKAN? Is there a limit to the number of points displayed on the map? Are there size limitations with feature services? How often are RSS Feeds updated? How do you link an image widget to datasets? Can people from other organizations add my open data to their sites? How can providers share formal metadata? How do you change the hover-over field? Can I use datasets from Open Data in ArcGIS for Desktop? Do you have to be a paying subscriber to use Open Data? Are hidden fields included when users download datasets? Q: Does using ArcGIS Open Data use the hosting organizationâs ArcGIS Online Credits? A: No. Organizations are never charged any credits for set-up or usage of their sites. The only way credits may be consumed is if you opt to host your data is in ArcGIS Online. Credit usage is based on the size of data stored, not on usage or number of downloads. Q: If I am hosting data on my own ArcGIS Server, what is the best way to serve them for use in Open Data? A: If you are setting up services with the exclusive purpose of serving them on an Open Data site we recommend you create a single map service then register each individual layer as an item in ArcGIS Online. With a single hosted map service, you can more easily control resource utilization on your server. With each layer registered as an individual item, you have control over metadata related to each layer in ArcGIS Online. Q: Can you upload and share data that has no geospatial component? A: Yes. Currently Open Data supports tables published in services that run local on ArcGIS for Server, or hosted in ArcGIS Online. You can also upload and share CSV files in ArcGIS Online that are up to 5mb and comma separated. Advanced users can leverage Esriâs Open Source Project KOOP to access non-spatial data from other sources, and provide a GeoServices REST API to the data. There are currently connectors for data stored in Github as well as in Socrata see more information here: https://github.com/esri/koop). Q: Is it possible to use Open Data to share only within my organization? A: Yes and no. You can limit access to your Open Data site to users in your organization with specific privileges, but all the datasets on that are on your site will be publicly available on ArcGIS Online. Additionally administrators of Open Data sites in other organizations can add your Open Data groups to their sites. Q: Can image services be shared via Open Data? A: No. At this time image services are not supported in the Open Data application. We are working to support imagery in a future release. Q: What is the output projection and can it be changed? A: The output projection for the map within the Open Data application is Web Mercator (EPSG: 3857), the same projection used within ArcGIS Online maps. The output projection for file downloads and APIs (where applicable) is WGS 84 (EPSG: 4326). At this time output projections cannot be changed. If you would like to provide downloads to users in additional formats, we recommend placing a link in the description text for the dataset. Q: If my organization is using a different coordinate system, do we need to re-project it to Web Mercator before using it in Open Data? A: No. ArcGIS Open Data handles data reprojection for you in the background. Q: Should I re-project my data to Web Mercator before publishing in Open Data? A: You do not have to, but it can help. Reprojecting your data to Web Mercator can improve performance when viewing the map in Open Data, since the data needs to be in Web Mercator to be display on the grey basemap. When your data is in a local projection, it is requested from the application in Web Mercator and the server may need additional processing time to reproject the data and provide a valid response. Note: Open Data will soon support custom base maps in local projections. In that case, if the projection of the data matches the projection of your basemap there will be no performance loss from reprojection. Q: Can one organization have multiple Open Data sites? A: Yes. An organization can have as many Open Data sites as they desire. For example a state-level organization could create Open Data sites for each county or a city could create an event-based (e.g. hackathon) site for a weekend and then take it down. Q: Is there an Open Data site gallery to let users know which organizations have public Open Data sites? A: Yes. There is an Open Data showcase located at http://dc.esri.com/showcase that shows handpicked Open Data sites that have been made public. Additionally, you can always visit http://opendata.arcgis.com/explore.json to download a file describing all Open Data sites that are currently public. Q: We need to ensure that our websites are accessible to people with disabilities that may be using screen-reading software. Are the site widgets designed with this in mind or would we have to supply our own HTML/CSS? A: At this time, Open Dataâs accessibility functions are a work in progress. If you have strict compliance requirements, you would need to supply your own HTML and CSS. Q: Do you integrate with other platforms like CKAN? A: Yes. All Open Data sites produce a catalog that CKAN can âharvestâ. To access this catalog simply append /data.json to the end of the URL for your Open Data site. Then, you will need to configure your CKAN instance to read that file. See some information about that here: https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-dcat. Q: Is there a limit to the number of points displayed on the map? A: Yes. Based on your map extent, we send 4-6 requests for data from your server. Depending on the max record count from your server (1-2000 by default) we can display 4-12000 features. If the map cannot render all of the data, we provide a message to zoom in. We are actively refining this experience. Q: Are there size limitations with feature services used in Open Data (number of features or file size)? A: No. Open Data can support downloading of very large datasets, and the larger the data the slower the download. Progress bars are in place to show that the download is being built, and communicate with the data consumer with the download is ready. While it may take a while to build up the initial download, subsequent downloads can be immediate. Q: How often are RSS Feeds updated? A: The search RSS feed will be updated each time a new item that meets that search criteria is added to the index. Dataset RSS feeds will be updated each time a new comment is posted on the item page within ArcGIS Online. Q: How do you link an image widget to datasets? A: You can link an image widget to specific datasets by placing a search URL into the Image Link box. The best way to find that search URL is to conduct a search on your site that brings up the correct layers and the copy the link that is created into your browser’s URL bar. Q: Can people from other organizations add my open data to their sites? A: Yes. Any Open Data administrator can add any Open Data group to their site regardless of their organization for no additional cost. This is helpful to those who want to create sites that are topic oriented or regional in scope, and allow for federated search across multiple authoritative organizations. Q: How can providers share formal metadata with the end users of Open Data sites? A: Open Data providers can place a link to the formal metadata in the description box of the ArcGIS Online item. Additional support for metadata will be coming in future versions of ArcGIS Online and the Open Data application. Q: How do you change the hover-over field? A: The hover over field is set in the map that is published within ArcMap. See here for documentation on making that change:Â http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.1/index.html#//005s0000003p000000 Q: Can I use datasets from Open Data in ArcGIS for Desktop? A: Yes. You can download a shapefile and load that into ArcMap or ArcGIS Pro or you can search ArcGIS Online from within ArcMap or ArcGIS Pro and add the source item to your map. Q: Do you have to be a paying subscriber to use Open Data? A: Yes. You must have an ArcGIS Online organizational subscription to publish an Open Data site. ArcGIS Online Subscriptions are included with every license of ArcGIS for Desktop, and annual subscription plans are available for purchase to accommodate more users. Note: Trial subscriptions can create Open Data sites, but they cannot make them available to the public. Q: Are hidden fields included when users download datasets? A: No. Fields that are hidden in ArcMap before a layer is published will neither show up in the Open Data application nor in any downloaded files. Caution: Do not hide the ObjectID field as this will cause errors in the Open Data application.
