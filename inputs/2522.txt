On Thursday, April 2, 2015, I attended a talk by Jack Halberstam at the University of Colorado Boulder. I was deeply concerned about the content of Dr. Halberstam’s talk, which I considered to be reflective of transphobic, transmisogynistic, and ableist discourses around identity, language use, and the impact of trauma on learning. I know I’mÂ not the only one who feels frustrated and disappointed by the rhetoric of Halberstam’s position on these issues (seeÂ guerilla feminism, feministing, colored queer waters, Julia Serano, andÂ La Bruja Morgan, just to name a few), although I think it can be scary and risky for those of us who are newer queer scholars to level a critique against such a prominent member of our field. Still, I think it’s important that we stand up against problematic positions, no matter who’s taking those positions. Speak your mind even if your voice shakes, and all that. I sent a letter of concern to the chairs of the five departmental sponsors of Halberstam’s talk. I was hoping to start a dialogue around how to make visible alternative perspectives on the issues Dr. Halberstam raised, and I was disappointed (but admittedly not very surprised) to learn that there didn’t appear to be much interest in dialogue around this issue. I received a polite but briefÂ response from one recipient, thanking me for stating my concerns but indicating no desire to engage in further conversation. I could describe my disappointment in my institution, detailing the reasons why I think people should take this issue seriously–but now I’m just avoiding the Main Event:Â my concerns themselves. Below, I’ve included the text of the letter I sent to the organizers of Halberstam’s talk on trigger warnings, trauma, and queer and trans identity politics. It apparently didn’t convince any of the original recipients to begin a dialogue about these issues, although I’m holding out hope that it’ll convince somebody, somewhere, to challenge problematic rhetoric about these issues, in ways big or small.   Dear [department chairs and] organizers of the jointly sponsored public lectures delivered by Dr. Jack Halberstam: Iâm writing to you as a member of CU Boulderâs community, and also as a queer and transgender person who was deeply disturbed by Jack Halberstamâs talk âTrigger Troubleâ on Thursday, April 2, 2015. In the talk, Dr. Halberstam spoke critically and, in my view, quite dismissively of those who speak in opposition to his position on trigger warnings, trauma, and the politics of language use; I hope this letterâwhich does indeed aim to speak in opposition to Halberstamâs viewsâwill be received more in the spirit of hearing and respecting alternative perspectives on a deeply divisive set of issues. I want to begin by saying how thrilled and grateful I am to be living and working in a community in which public talks like Dr. Halberstamâs are not only possible, but also well attended and well received. I was delighted to be sitting in a packed and attentive room of students, faculty, and community members who were ready and willing to engage with issues of trauma and learning and the politics of queer and trans identities. I was also thrilled to see that the audience was not primarily queer or transgenderâthat attendees represented a wide range of sexual and gender identities. The wide range of identities and experiences that attendees brought to Dr. Halberstamâs talk, however, also made me concerned about how some key points were received. The talk touched on many complicated issues that are hotly debated among queer and transgender people, and attendees who may not be aware of those complexities could easily have come away from the talk feeling that they have permission to say and do certain things that could be harmful and even dangerous to members of marginalized communities.Â  First, attendees may have come away from Dr. Halberstamâs talk feeling as if they have permission to use the word âtrannyâ and to be critical of those who have called for people to discontinue use of that word. My concerns about this come from my experiences as a transgender person, and also from my experiences as an education researcher whose work focuses on issues of sexual and gender identities in classrooms. Iâve witnessed firsthandâin my own life and through my work in schoolsâthe power that words like âtrannyâ have over perceptions of what kinds of bodies have a right to exist, and why, and in what capacity. As a trans man, Iâve never been on the receiving end of that particular slurâitâs generally reserved in our culture for transgender women, a group at great risk of verbal, social, and physical violence. Iâm sensitive to calls by many trans women for all who do not identify as transfeminine to stop using a word that has an offensive, painful, and violent historyâmany have drawn a link between the symbolic violence connoted in the circulation of the word âtrannyâ among non-trans communities and the very real physical violence visited upon the bodies of trans women every day around the world. I was surprised to hear Dr. Halberstam use the word so flagrantly, and to defend his use of the word using a similar rationale to that used by some white people who choose to use the n-word. In expressing outrage at the successful campaign to have the well known bar âTrannyshackâ renamed out of deference to those who oppose the term, Dr. Halberstam said, âTrannies call each other trannies, ok? So there’s no need to go on a puritanical panic over Trannyshack.” Later, during the question and answer period, Dr. Halberstam addressed this issue more directly, first when one audience member asked him to discuss why he chose to say âthe n-wordâ instead of using the actual n-word in his talk, and second when another audience member (Iâll admit: it was me) asked why he chose to use the word âtrannyâ despite calls from many trans women for non-transwomen to stop using the word. In his response to these questions, Dr. Halberstam stated first that he wanted to respect calls from African AmericansÂ for white people not to use a term that many Black people find offensive, and then that those who take issue with the term âtrannyâ are overly sensitive and that, furthermore, the well known trans performer Justin Vivian Bond likes the word âtrannyâ and wants people to use it to refer to Mx Bond. Iâm concerned that audience members will fail to see the contradictions in Dr. Halberstamâs position on the n-word and on the word âtranny.â Iâm particularly concerned that non-trans audience members, who are less likely to know the complicated history of transmisogyny in the United States and the world, will view Dr. Halberstamâs talk as permission to use a word that many, many trans women have claimed unambiguously to be offensive, demeaning, and violent. Â Â  Iâm also concerned about how audience members may act on Dr. Halberstamâs characterization of trauma, triggers, and trigger warnings in college classrooms. On this issue, I speak not only from my experience as a queer and trans person, but also as a feminist educator who has been teaching college students for over a decade. Iâve taught English, writing, business, and education courses at a half dozen universities around the country, and in that time Iâve witnessed firsthand the impact of trauma on some studentsâ ability to focus, to engage, and to learn. A large body of research on trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder tells us that symptoms of PTSD can be triggered by a wide range of stimuli. Some of these stimuli are sensoryâtaste, touch, sight, sound, and smellâand some can be cognitive. Reading about a traumatic event can trigger a post-traumatic response for some trauma survivors; a lecture on domestic violence or rape can activate numbness, flashbacks, and similar responses. In my classes, I often introduce material that touches on difficult social issues including violence, misogyny, ableism, and racial and class-based inequitiesâand Iâve tried to do this in a way that is sensitive to my studentsâ varied experiences with these and other issues. Still, Iâve seen studentsâ faces go shuttered and blank; Iâve seen studentsâ bodies go rigid or slack; Iâve seen students react with numbness or panic to readings and discussions about these difficult topics. The first few times this happened, I was profoundly ill-prepared to respond: Teachers are generally not exposed to scholarship and pedagogical strategies aimed at addressing traumatic responses to course content. I could easily have perceived these students as disruptive or entitled, as Dr. Halberstam in his talk characterized those who claim to be triggered by difficult course content. Had I made this assumption and acted on it, I would have been visiting a new form of trauma on these students: The trauma of skepticism, disbelief, and silencing. Iâm concerned, then, that those audience members who teach at CU and other institutions of higher education may perceive Dr. Halberstamâs position on trauma and trigger warnings as permission to ignore, minimize, or dismiss what I know to be a very real experience of trauma and feeling triggered by classroom materials. I was particularly concerned by Dr. Halberstamâs mischaracterization of triggers. In his talk, Dr. Halberstam stated that while something like a car alarm might be a trigger for a victim of sexual assault, âreading information about sexual assault is just not a trigger. It’s not. It’s just not.â This statement is factually untrueâit flies in the face of decades of research on the aftereffects of trauma. Audience members could easily have walked away from Dr. Halberstamâs talk with a troublesome misunderstanding of what constitutes a trigger and how people might react when exposed to violent or traumatic content. As an educator, I worry about how this misunderstanding might be applied in deeply problematic ways in the classroom; and I feel a need to protect my current and future students from what might happen if educators accepted Dr. Halberstamâs inaccurate and incomplete description of trauma and triggers.Â  Finally, I was deeply disheartened by Dr. Halberstamâs dismissive stance regarding those who oppose his perspectives on triggers, trauma, and the politics of queer and trans identitites. He characterized those who disagree with him as cultural overcorrectors, caricatures of political correctness and overwrought youth who lack a sense of humor. He also suggested at many points during his talk that the lionâs share of those who stand in opposition to him are transgender women and menâin fact, I wouldnât be surprised if this was an accurate assessment, since in my view Dr. Halberstamâs stance reflects and reproduces deeply transphobic, transmisogynistic, and ableist cultural perspectives. I felt that Dr. Halberstam made trans people a source of ridicule, and felt this very strongly when he paired his description of transgender protesters at a performing arts conference he attended with a clip from Monty Pythonâs Life of Brian that depicted a caricature of a transgender woman arguing that people should fight for her right to bear children even though this is a biological impossibility. I heard audience members laughing at trans women. I heard them laughing at the very idea of renaming Trannyshack âT Shack.â There I was, a transgender person sitting in an audience composed of members of my professional community, listening to people who did not identify as transgender laughing at trans people. I have wondered in the days since Dr. Halberstamâs talk whether other attendees of this talk have felt similar concerns about the tone, approach, and content of this event. Have you heard concerns from queer or nonqueer, trans or cisgender attendees? Have other educators, social workers, or psychologists spoken about concerns over how Dr. Halberstam characterized triggers and trauma?Â  I am also wondering if there has been any talk of responding to the ideas set forth by Dr. Halberstam. I would be happy to participate in a conversation about this, and I have some ideas for appropriate strategies for making visible alternative perspectives on these issues. I thank you for taking the time to read and consider my concerns, and again, I hope they are received in the spirit of openness, dialogue, and consideration of multiple perspectives. Iâm grateful for the opportunity to be living and working in a context where issues like those raised by Dr. Halberstam can be discussed by students and faculty across departments and disciplines, and I look forward to attending future lectures sponsored by the Department of English, the GLBTQ Resource Center, LGBTQ Studies, Women and Gender Studies, the Chancellorâs Advisory Committee on GLBT Issues, and the Graduate Committee on the Arts and Humanities.
