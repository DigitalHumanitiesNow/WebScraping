Had a very good trip to the US (apart from the trans-atlantic flights) and now I'm back! Let's see what I have been missing -Modojo laments the sad state of augmented reality video games: "Thus far, no company has been willing to create an augmented reality video game based on a million selling series. Everything's a new intellectual property, which is usually a hard sell, even without AR".The above article mentions Reality Fighters, published by Sony, which actually looks pretty cool.Augmented reality and books, together at last? meh.Design concept: Papyrus - communication with time, augmented reality display of buildings' past glory. This concept is not that far-fetched, seeing that Layar has "historic layers".QR goodness (1):  In the Netherlands (and thus, Europe) they have QR codes on legal tender now.QR goodness (2): In south Korea, Tesco brings virtual shop fronts to busy commuters, enhancing ad displays.And in a field closely related to AR - io9 asks whether the rise of wearable electronics is finally here.It's been a while since we have featured a kinect hack in the weekly video spot, so I'm happy to present, Saint Kinect, created by Youtube user koshiik with "100 lines of code and 2 beers". Fight the devil wearing a halo on your head - Have a great week!
