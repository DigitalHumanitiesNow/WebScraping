We are pleased to announce that Networked Infrastructure for Nineteenth-Century Electronic Scholarship will be partnering with theÂ Digital Humanities Summer InstituteÂ (DHSI) in order to offer opportunities for members to participate in the series of DH courses at the University of Victoria, June 1st-5th 2015, June 8th-12th 2015, and June 15th-19th 2015. RegistrationÂ for DHSI is now open. This year will see an expansion from the regular 1 week institute to 3 weeks of courses, in part to support those enrolled in theÂ Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities at U Victoria. Participants may choose to attend 1, 2, or all 3 week-long workshops. In 2015, 40 courses ranging from old favourites to exciting first-time ventures will be on offer. Each week of DHSI will include a week long training workshop, and the core week (June 8th-12th) will also include morning colloquia, lunchtime unconferences, and Birds-of-a-Feather sessions. Throughout the institute, keynote lectures will be led by Malte Rehbein (U Passau), David Hoover (NYU), Claire Warwick (UC London), and Constance Crompton (UBC Okanagan). Tuition scholarships are available for students, and NINES members can register at a discounted cost of $300.00 for students and $650.00 for non-students (for registration before April 1st 2015). For a full list of courses, to register, to apply for a tuition scholarship, or for more information, please go toÂ dhsi.org. Make sure to register with a NINES discount code (NINES-Student or NINES-Non-Student).
