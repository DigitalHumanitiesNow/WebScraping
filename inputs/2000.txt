The Glossarium Graeco-Arabicum, hosted by the Ruhr-Universität Bochum, is since 2010 part of the ERC advanced       project “Greek into Arabic - Philosophical Concepts and Linguistic Bridges”. It makes available the files of the lexical project, intended to open up the lexicon of the mediæval Arabic translations from the Greek. From the eighth to the tenth century A. D., Greek scientific and philosophical works were translated wholesale into Arabic. This activity resulted in the incorporation and reorganization of the classical heritage in the new civilization which, using Arabic, spread with Islam. The object of the project Glossarium Graeco-Arabicum is to make readily available to scholars the direct information which the Graeco-Arabic translations contain for several areas of research.
