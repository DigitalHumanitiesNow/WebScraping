 Please join the CUNY Digital Humanities Initiative, the English Program, and the Futures Initiative in welcoming Dr. Jennifer Guiliano, who will lead a grant writing workshop specifically aimed towards scholars working in the humanities. This event will take place Friday, April 24th, at 2pm in the English Program Lounge (4406) at the Graduate Center, CUNY. RSVP recommended:Â  https://www.eventbrite.com/e/grant-writing-for-humanists-tickets-16105258261. Designed for humanities scholars seeking assistance with writing grants, this workshop introduces participants to best practices in writing and submitting a grant. This workshop will allow participants to work through key grant writing concepts, understand the process of developing successful grants, and allow them the opportunity to engage with a series of online resources, including presentations, exemplar successful grants, and podcasts that will position them to be successful in their grant-writing. A combination of lecture and hands-on, the workshop will result in a map for attendees to follow to complete their first (or improve their existing) grant. Recommended: BYODevices and abstracts or materials for your current project. Collaborative projects welcome!
