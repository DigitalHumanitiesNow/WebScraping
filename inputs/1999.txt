TThe Historical Language e-Learning Project is currently building a system to game-ify the learning of historical languages, beginning with Ancient Greek. Linguistic data drives the pilot pilot project, in which we will prepare students to read Thucydides through a dynamic syllabus released in January 2014. Later syllabi will generalize the approach, allowing students to work with material of their choice. In addition to targeting reading fluency, our materials will enable students to contribute to the morpho-syntactic annotation of textual sources. This morpho-syntactic annotation will then serve as the foundation for further computational linguistic research and iterations of pedagogical material. The Project understands the need for multilingual resources, and our localized approach will enable students to complete games and exercises in their L1, including translation production and alignment. We will publish initial resources in English, Persian, and Croatian, with more languages to follow. Furthermore, we are committed to the free exchange of data and instruction, and all code, text, and learning resources will be available under open licenses. We will use the back-end analysis of learning behavior and student error to inform the future publications of dynamic resources adaptable to individual differences in learning. As part of the Open Philology Project at UniversitaÌˆt Leipzig, the Historical Language e-Learning Project builds upon the work of a number of international collaborators, particularly the work of Alpheios, the Perseus Digital Library, Perseids and the Homer Multitext Project.
