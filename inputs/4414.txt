Weâre going into our fourth year at UCL Centre for Digital Humanities, and there have been quite a  few changes along the way. Since the centre was founded under the  direction of Professor Claire Warwick, Claire has also taken on Head of Department in UCL Department of Information Studies, as well as Vice Dean of Research for the Arts and Humanities faculty. Over the past year, Claire and I  have been co-directing the centre. Iâm pleased, proud, and a little bit  nervous to say that from now on Iâll be taking on full operational  duties as Director of UCLDH, still working closely with Claire, who  remains committed to Digital Humanities as a subject, and UCLDH in  particular. Iâd like to take this opportunity to thank Claire for her  continued input into UCLDH â and I look forward to working with her in  this slightly different capacity over the next few years, as well as the  rest of the team at UCLDH, and putting my efforts into building up  UCLDH even further after its great start.Onwards!
