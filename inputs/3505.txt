I’m looking forward to directing a seminar next month at my undergraduate alma mater, Oklahoma University’s Oklahoma Scholar-Leadership Enrichment Program, which I took part in as an undergraduate–the best part of my college career, really, so it’s an honor to contribute to it. The seminar, on “Media, Culture, and the Digital Humanities,” meets May 12-16, 2014.
