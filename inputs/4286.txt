  I talked a bit about Murray’s Dude Ranch, in Victorville, CA early on in the blog’s history, when I was posting about Herb Jeffries, the singing cowboy and The Bronze Buckaroo. Many of the Jeffries films, including BB were shot at Murray’s, a dude ranch in the desert about an hour from Los Angeles that catered to an African American clientele, beginning way back in the early part of the 20th century.Â  Â  Earlier, I had linked a short history by the National Park Service, because there were very few artifacts of or histories about Murray’s to refer to, and it only exists, like many of the sites from the Green Book, primarily in people’s memories and a few newsclippings here and there. So I was pretty excited to obtain this postcard, which I believe to be original, that depicts Murray’s as the “Overall Wearing Dude Ranch” in Victorville, CA.Â  This image is just completely amazing, and the level of detail and the discreet visibility of the structures make it the clearest image I have every come across of this site. There’s no date or writing on the back, but its the only thing like it I’ve ever seen, and I’m guessing from the way the ranch is built out that it dates fromÂ  before WWII.Â  With it, and the clips from Bronze Buckaroo, supplemented by the archival clips,Â  I potentially might be able to reconstruct a site plan or at least a schematic.Â  Because Murray’s heydey dates from from the 1920s, as opposed to most of the other sites I’m looking at that date from the 1950s, finding living eye-witnesses is much harder, but I suspect that in some of the papers and oral histories of west coast jazz musicians that are held in collections around Los Angeles, I might find a mention of Murray’s. That, along with the history of the Murray’s themselves, might be enough to piece together a serviceable history of this extraordinary lost place.  Here is the listing for Murray’s in the Green Book (1949) that is online and mentioned in the Slate.com piece. I will try to dig up the ad from Travelguide and post as well.
