Walters Museum Exhibit - "Treasures of Heaven": Normally Iâm skeptical of âdigital museumâ exhibitions, let alone with so unpromising a promise as â3Dâ!  But, theyâve done a really nice job from a usability standpoint (though, flashâ¦)  The 8 objects have been photographed in delightfully high resolution, and stitched together with a rotate/zoom feature thatâs basically zoomify for a three-dimensional object.  Itâs an instinctive interface, and theyâve gone all Web 2.0 on the exhibitionâs presentation (including the fabulous touch of the detailed images being visible behind the transparent navigation menus).  The interface, in fact, begs to be viewed on an iPad, inasmuch as it models physical engagement with the objects displayed, which makes the Flash choice all the more unfortunate.  That quibble aside, itâs fabulous work - congratulations on a wonderful digital resource to accompany what looks like a delightful exhibition.
