My notes, apologies for any mistakes.  Session: From Open Data to Open Science: Policy, Literacy and Citizen Engagement Moderator: Francois Grey,Â Citizen Cyberscience Centre/Â University of Geneva Why Science is an Open Endeavor â Â Victoria Stodden, Professor of Statistics,Â Columbia University – See more at: http://okcon.org/open-science-and-research/session-1/#sthash.WekP0tAJ.dpuf My notes: @victoriastroddenÂ on role of computation in scientific research. Donoho: says that its not the published article that is the scholarship, the article is the advertisment the scholarly contribution. We need to update the scientific record. Branch 1: deductive – with the idea of the proof Branch 2: empirical – with the idea of hypothesis testing, and structured methods (protocols) So add Branch 3/4?: computational – large scale simulations, data driven computational science. Using big data. Â – what do we have here? to qualify the findings?Â Scientific method is to root out error. And computational science today doesn’t generate reliable knowledge. Â So the availability of code, in order to verify it, is essential.Â  Victoria’s slides are here:Â http://t.co/Iq7VY7YonL We shouldn’t need a special language to discuss the reproducibility of experiments. Of scientific enquiry. Open Health â The Citizenâs Revolution â Â Ernst Hafen,Â CSO,Â healthbankÂ /Â ETH Zurich For the future of health and medicine to become personalized, preventive and predictive is also needs to become participatory. The need for millions of health data sets requires the active participation of healthy individuals and patients. This will be promoted by empowering individuals by giving them control over their health data (medical, omics, mHealth etc). InÂ healthbank, a Swiss health databank, citizens from all over the world can securely store, manage, and contribute anonymized selected health data for research. Since healthbank is organized as a cooperative, members not only control their data, they are also owners of healthbank and share its profits. – See more at: http://okcon.org/open-science-and-research/session-1/#sthash.WekP0tAJ.dpuf My notes: Health Data platform: http://datenundgesundheit.ch Multi-agency, multi-national. Upping our digital literacy â Â Kaitlin Thaney, Director,Â Mozilla Science Lab Despite the influx of tools and policies under development to advance the broader goal of open science, weâre still facing a critical gap in our education system. The newly launched Mozilla Science Lab, an open science project supported by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, is looking to help close that gap in skills development so that making research more efficient isnât only accessible to the chosen elite. This talk will look at some of the broader issues surrounding disrupting the current educational system, and explore what âdigital literacyâ looks like for science, so we can better arm the next generation of researchers (as well as the PIs and advisors) with the skills to truly enact change. – See more at: http://okcon.org/open-science-and-research/session-1/#sthash.WekP0tAJ.dpuf My notes: @kaythaney of @mozillascience Kaitlin talking about OpenNews project. Open web to change the way that science is done. Â A key to this is digital literacy (@mozteach). Â They’ve run a MOOC about teaching using the web. Science is becoming more data driven. There is a skills gap developing. Mozilla Science Lab: All of these layers are interdependent on one another: Community – buildings communities of practice for keeping up to date with tools, best practice, communities, etc. Have a skills training programme. Code Code/Data Literacy Software Carpentry Programme:Â http://software-carpentry.org/v4/invperc/ It’s all about making sure that education is producing professionals who have the skills that are necessary for 21st century jobs. Kaitlin’s blog:Â http://kaythaney.com/ “Reliance on ad-hoc, self-education about what’s possible doesn’t scale.” Introducing CC Science Affiliates Network â Puneet Kishor,Â Project Coordinator for Science and Data, Creative CommonsÂ (CC) As a small organization with a global ambition, reach, and footprint, CC is only as strong as its community. CC canât be everywhere, and that is where its community steps in, using CC licenses, promoting the values underlying those licenses, and championing openness. In keeping with CCâs vision of ârealizing the full potential of the Internet â universal access to research and education, full participation in culture â to drive a new era of development, growth, and productivityâ, one of the core strategic objectives of CC Science is to âGrow the Community.â CC Science Affiliates Network aims to strengthen CCâs science outreach by: including local and regional scientific voices in the global conversation on open science; making CC more responsive to scientific concerns worldwide; and providing scientists who are friendly toward open science and access the full power of a global community.Â We will introduce the CC Science Affiliates Network, highlight synergies between it and OKFNâs outreach programs such as the OKFN Ambassadors program, and invite participation from the OKFN community. – See more at: http://okcon.org/open-science-and-research/session-1/#sthash.WekP0tAJ.dpuf My notes: Openness is not evenly distributed. CC has lots of volunteers, called CC Affiliates. At a recent meeting of CC Affiliates, Puneet noted that there were very few Scientists from developing countries represented. So this needs to change. Most affiliates are from a legal background, mostly because of the way that CC developed. Science Affiliates Network. OKF is the mechanism whereby CC and its vision is achieved. i.e. “Realising the full potential of the internet”
