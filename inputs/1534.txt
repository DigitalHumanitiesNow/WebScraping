 NetGloW â14:Â Bridging Theory and Method:Â American, European, and Russian Studies June 27-29, St Petersburg, Russia I will remotely participate in the conference “Networks in the Global World 2014. Bridging Theory and Methods: American, European and Russian Studies” taking place in St Petersburg, Russia, June 27-29 2014. The 2 day, single-track conference will also have pre-conference workshops including a day devoted to using the NodeXL social media network analysis application. The primary organizing institution and host is the Centre for German and European Studies, Bielefeld University and the St Petersburg State University. This will be the 2nd Networks in the Global World conference (for information on the 1st one held in 2012 see http://www.ngw.spbu.ru). This conference series brings together researchers exploring cutting edge networks research from around the globe. In 2014 the focus is on linking theory and methods that integrate information, communication, semantic and cultural networks. The primary goal of the NetGloW conference series is to bring together networks researchers from around the globe, to unite the efforts of various scientific disciplines in response to the key challenges faced by network studies today, and to exchange local research results â thus allowing an analysis of global processes. It is also crucial for us to support junior researchersâ orientation in the complex landscape of network science, and to encourage applications of network analysis by practitioners. The idea of the 2014 event is to discuss the key current issues and problems of linking theoretical and methodological developments in network analysis. The structure of the conference: June 27th â workshops and seminar for practitioners; June 28th & 29th â presentations.
