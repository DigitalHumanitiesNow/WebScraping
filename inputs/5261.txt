I keep asking people, “So did you hear about horse_ebooks?” But while my Twitter feed went a little crazy this week, people in real life had no idea what @horse_ebooks was or why a spambot reveal mattered. And I don’t know why either! But I still have these totally weird wistful feelings about the whole thing. The sequence of events: Horse_ebooks takes over the internet (Daniel D’Addario, February 2012) How I found the human being behind Horse_ebooks, the internet’s favorite spambot (Adrian Chen, February 2012) (red herring?) Horse_ebooks is human after all (Susan Orlean, September 2013) Eulogy for a horse. (Dan Sinker, September 2013) @Horse_ebooks, and the Internet we thought we knew (Marie Connelly, September 2013) Sigh. Here are some semi-hi-res commemorative tweet screenshots. Click through and hang them sadly on your office bulletin board, if you want.  (original tweet) (original tweet)
