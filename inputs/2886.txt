I've been blogging at this web address since 2008 when I had to set up a blog for a digital history class as part of my MA in Public History.  This past weekend I finally got around to registering my own domain and setting up a more permanent site. You can check it out at kristamccracken.ca Given how easy it was to migrate content from blogger, register the domain, and install WordPress on the site I'm not sure why I waited so long to move things over.  If you follow this blog by RSS feed please update your feed to the new address.  All new blog posts will be at the new site. Onwards and Upwards.
