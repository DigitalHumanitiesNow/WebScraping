One of the many stacks of books and papers in my office. Freelancing is one of the most exhausting things I’ve done in my life. It’s easy to get overwhelmed, and often administrative tasks feel like they’re derailing my creative duties, and vice versa. Because of the added dimension of chronic illness in my life, anything that keeps me organized or inspired is worth its weight in gold. Below are some of my favorite links and books for keeping myself on target and enjoying what I do.     The Artist’s WayÂ Julia Cameron’s book is one of those classics that gets recommended for good reason. If it works for you, it really works for you. It’s not a how-to manual to writing, or painting, or any given art form. Â It’s…creative therapy, I guess? Though the affirmations to say daily usually make me laugh, and I often raise my eyebrows at the tone of the book, it’s been slowly forcing me back into regular journaling, which usually gets me to shake off enough mental chaff to have a great wordcount day. For me, the takeaways from Artist’s Way was the importance of creative routines, telling my inner critic to shut up till I’m done with a draft, and to pay attention to why I was avoiding particular projects.   The War of Art Steven Pressfield’s book is applicable across most creative jobs. What we perceive as ‘writer’s block’ or ‘artist’s block’ is generally our own negative inner monologue, our fears, depression, and the cold rock of chronic illness and fatigue sapping your will and confidence. These are all things that take effort, time and persistence to work with. Pressfield’s book reminds the reader that the balking to start, continue, or finish our art is something we have to fight. It’s simply a part of life, we kick its ass, we keep going. When I’m dealing with inertia on a project, I like to read this book to feel both assured that my experience is normal, and reminded that I can get past it. I really loathe the term “inspiring read,” but it’s one of those books that will at least lure you back to your workspace to try again.   Links   How to Keep Perspective When Youâre Living the Movie Youâre Making DirectorÂ Tai UhlmannÂ has some beautiful advice on keeping perspective when a project is close to you. This kind of struggle is hardest, I think, with autobiographical projects, but it’s easy to become too consumed and over-identity with our art to the exclusion of who we are when we’re not engaged with making a specific project. This is a good read for anyone who gets tangled up in their art, or has issues keeping a grounded perspective during projects. How I Stayed Focused on My Screenplay Short and sweet tips from Jessica M. Thompson on how she stays on point with her screenplay. Worth mining regardless of your creative specialty. Design Dilemma Solved: Conquering the Paper Clutter Paper is one of those things that I’ll be fighting till I die. Old invoice forms, mail, you name it. This is just a few brief suggestions from office stylist Sayeh on organizing your own paperwork mountains and keeping them from taking you out in an avalanche. Staying Productive with Clinical Depression, for indie game developers Kitty Horrorshow’s mini guide for staying productive with clinical depression is so incredibly useful, and there’s a lot of applicability to creators with chronic illness and disability. If you haven’t thought about managing your art and your physical/psychological resources, this is a good place to start thinking about those things. We are not lesser artists or professionals because we have to do frequent accounting about our health and our creative output. When we manage both our health and our art, we are being the best artists we are capable of.
