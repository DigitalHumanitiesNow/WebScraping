So here’s something that happened to me yesterday at the AERA Annual Meeting: I gave a talk about my dissertation (.pdf)Â Â in a roundtable sponsored by the Queer Studies Special Interest Group. I began my presentationÂ with a rationale for my work:Â I talked about the material and symbolic violence committed against trans bodies and then described how misogyny and transphobia get internalized really early and that in order to counteract this it’s important to help kids think about gender outside the binary and during the q&a some guy raised his hand and said really angrily, “I want to know what gives you the moral authority to do this kind of work with kids.” A slide from my presentation: On the exact same day as this Time Magazine issue was released, the NCAVP report on hate violence noted that trans people, and particularly trans women of color, are disproportionately targeted for physical, verbal, and sexual violence. I was surprised, as maybe you can imagine, and I said “I’m not really sure what you’re asking…”Â and he repeatedÂ it multiple times in a row, “what gives you the moral AUTHORITY, what gives YOU the moral authority” etc. (I know this because the discourse analysts in the room paid attention and told me later) and I said “I’m curious about the impulse behind your question but I can tell you why I picked the age group I did and also I believe you came in late so you missed the rationale I provided” and then basically everyqueer in the room shot their hand up to further expound on why my work is important. Then he muttered to himself for a few minutes and walked away and then I said “hey, let’s talk about what just happened!” And we talked about how hard it is to present queer work and how great it was that the secret homophobia or dismissiveness that leads reviewers to reject our work happened in public where people could witness it. So…on balance, I think that went well.   Tweet This Post
