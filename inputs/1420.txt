I found an article on America: History and Life (requires subscription) that I wanted. There were three links to the article. One took me to Ingenta, where the article would cost me about $23. Another link took me to Taylor and Francis, where I could download the article for free.  Which do you think I chose?  Update: I realized after I posted that GMU subscribes to Taylor and Francis, so it might not actually be free for non-GMU users. So, this probably wasn't the best example of Open-access versus subscription-based access. If fact, I know it wasn't. Nevertheless, because I honor the idea that blog entries must remain published after the fact, I keep my oversight online and available to all who wish to criticize.
