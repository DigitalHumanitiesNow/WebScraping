Forgotten NY -- Some really great images of fogotten places in New York City. See especially the sections on street scenes, old advertising, and plastered 1950s posters.  That Certain Smile -- The Google cache version of an article in Le Monde diplomatique. (I didn't realize Google could cache the full-text of articles that are available by subscription only.) Lots to disagree with (which I'll write about later), but interesting to think about.  Mac OS Through the Years -- A graphic walk down memory lane for any Mac lovers. My aunt had a Classic II that ran System 7 (I think). It still works.  View of Glasgow and the Clyde -- Some nice photographs from 1911.
