 	 		Composer Jerry Bock (R) & lyricist Sheldon Harnick (L) performing at 100th birthday tribute to legendary Broadway director George Abbott, "Happy Birthday, Mr. Abbott!." (New York). 			Image ID: swope_1191891  A few months ago, I posted three demo recordings of Fiorello! from the Jerry Bock recordings in the Rodgers and Hammerstein Archives of Recorded Sound. Â This month, in honor of Fiddler's 50th anniversary, I am happy to share six demos ofÂ Fiddler on the Roof.Â  These recordings are discussed in Alisa Solomon's excellent book, Wonder of Wonders: A Cultural History of Fiddler on the Roof and some similar recordings have been previously released onÂ the Harbinger Records album: "Sheldon Harnick: Â Hidden Treasures." Â Today you can hear the show develop from Bock's musical seedsÂ  in demos 1,3,5, and 6 to more fully realized demos with lyrics in demos 2 and 4. Enjoy!
