The Public Philosophy Journal has received financial support from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The Public Philosophy Journal, or PPJ, is an open access and open peer review journal. Upon its establishment, the PPJ will redefine the relationship between academic philosophy and everyday life within a public space for accessible, but rigorous, scholarly discussion regarding contemporary issues of public concern. The awarded amount of nearly $530,000 will assist years two and three of the Public Philosophy Journalâs development. The Public Philosophy Journal is the product of the dynamic partnerships between Pennsylvania State Universityâs Department of Philosophy and Humanities in a Digital Age initiative and Michigan State Universityâs Matrix: The Center for Digital Humanities and Social Sciences and the Department of Philosophy. The practice of public philosophy enables members of the academy and members of the broader public to engage with one another in open, digital spaces that ultimately benefit both academic philosophy and public discourse. In this setting, the PPJ will facilitate the ability for philosophers to play a role as actual agents of change, and not merely as commentators or critics. The money awarded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation will build upon the progress achieved during the first year of the Public Philosophy Journalâs development. Goals for the next two years include the acquisition of a new networks of users, testing of the PPJâs interface and platform, establishment of the PPJâs Graduate Student Mentoring Program, and initial publishing of open peer-reviewed artifacts in the journal. The team behind the Public Philosophy Journalâs successful establishment is extremely appreciative of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundationâs support.
