(This is the blog post I've put up on the Day of DH site - where Digital Humanists all over the world are telling people what they are up to on a specific day. Me, I'm working hard in a different way, on holiday).  This Day of DH sees me not doing much DH at allâ¦ but yet. Iâm on  holiday, on the second week of the school easter break, with my three  young boys, in Scotland, staying with family. I wasnât going to blog  anything at all â but then, hey, this is part of my life as a DHer too,  right? Its not just about the work, its about what you do elsewhere? But  can you actually switch off from DH, from work, when you are away?â at  least, it seems not that way if you are an academic.So what did we get up to today? Not a bad night, up only three times  (two night terrors and one sea shanty) and then woken early to a boy  shouting âMummy! Robot! Monkey!â repeatedly. A slow walk to the shop for  papers and sweeties, some playing with watering cans, a trip to a  garden centre to meet an old friend and her kid for coffee, a visit from  my Aunt. The endless cleaning and tidying and management of stuff which  comes with having three small people, roll calls to ensure people have  their shoes and their stuffed animals from one stop to the next.  Highlights included driving alongside a wind farm for a mile or so and  the boys shouting âBIG. WINDMILLS! BIG. WINDMILLS!â â lowlights include  turning my back for two minutes and seeing Twin Two up 8 feet in the air  on something he shouldnât be climbing on in the garden centre â tuts  from other parents in the vicinity very forthcoming.Its not like I havenât thought about work. I find it very difficult  to switch off when on holiday â it takes me about a week to stop sending  myself emails reminding me to do X, Y, and Z when I get back. Iâm on  the twitters â I find hanging out on twitter gets me through the day  when looking after the three weans all day and all night, especially if  they are up through the night â and today of all days, it was  fascinating to see twitter erupt and turn and shift around a news item.  The asynchronous nature suits having a quick shufty at quiet moments â  seconds â in the parenting day. But I havenât been on work email for a  week or so, and wont be for another week or so. Usually Iâm glued to it,  answering emails at all times of the day, but its important for me to  step back from it a few times a year. I popped on there a couple of days  ago to action something time-limited and laughed at all the emails that  had come in setting me deadlines I hadnât agreed to that I will miss in  my absence. Meh â Iâm usually quick on the mark but this week? Iâm  teaching my twins how to do forward rolls instead.As I do more and more managerial work in my role at UCL Centre for Digital Humanities I wonder really how much of my interaction with computing is through  email. (Most of it now). Iâm a professional email answerer, really.   Been a while since I implemented something myself.  I wonder, amidst all  the arguments about should DHers code, etc, how the whole âcan code,  but manages codersâ fits in. But this week, Iâm not even answering  email. Oh no.  Iâm on holiday. Iâm away. And goodness, it is good to  step away from email, that harsh, thankless taskmistress. But if Iâm not  on emailâ¦. I am a DHer any more?But its not like I havenât thought about work. Itâs the  blessing/curse of academia: obsessive compulsive behavior is rewarded,  and its hard to switch off the obsession. So in the past week or so Iâve  been ruminating on next steps, projects Iâm undertaking, research I  should do next, blog posts that are brewing, in between having cups of  tea at my grandparents or visiting my cousins or dandling poorly boys at  3am. Everything you can do when you are not on email. The nice stuff  online and offline, without the work email.Itâs not that I havenât thought about work. Heck, I even blogged for  the Day of DH. An example of the blended life style us DHers live: how  hard it is to get away, even when you are away, how connected we all  are, how itâs all a balancing act.So Iâm not sure that this is a blog post. Iâm not sure that this is a holiday.  I donât know what it isâ¦ must be DH, then.
