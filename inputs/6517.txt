I had the pleasure last week to attend a lecture by Kavita Philip on “Databases and Politics: Some Lessons from Doing South Asian STS,” part of a series sponsored by UVa’s STS department (as well as, in this case, both Women’s Studies and Middle Eastern Studies). Philip is a professor of history at UC Irvine [&#8230;]
