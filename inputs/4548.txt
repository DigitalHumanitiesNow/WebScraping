This is the first in a two-part series about the Santa Cruz Museum of Art & Historyâs new theory of change. This week, Ian David Moss and I are         each writing blog posts about our collaborative process to develop a theory of change at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art & History. Check out his blog        post on the Fractured Atlas site. Next week, Iâll share more about what is in our theory of change, and why.For three years, we hit the gas at my museumâhard. We were pointed in a new direction and knew we had to push ourselves to expand our community impact.Three years in, the dust settled on the many changes. We had tripled our attendance. Doubled our staff. Experimented, launched, and retired many programs     and exhibition formats. We decided it was time to shift from exploring to deepening. A little over a year ago, we received a three-year grant from the James Irvine Foundation to     strengthen our commitment to community engagement. One of the first things we decided we had to do was to grow some roots under the new strategies at the     museum. We embarked on a process of ânaming and claimingâ the work we do. Where to start? We decided to develop three things:Clear engagement goals that define how we do our workA theory of change to connect what we do to the impact we seekAn engagement handbook to provide an overview of our goals, our theory of change, and the programs where they are manifestIâve written about the engagement goals before. Iâll write about the handbook soon. This blog post focuses on the theory of change and the process by which     we developed it. A theory of change is a model that connects: the activities we do, to the outcomes they effect, to the impact we seek to create in the     world. We wanted to build a theory of change for two reasons:Externally, we need strong, data-driven arguments for support. We canât just say,â fund this exhibition and the community will grow stronger.â We have     to prove it. Donors want to understand the logic of how their dollars will translate into impact. A strong theory of change can make that case. Internally, everyone needs to know what âgoodâ looks like and how their work helps contribute to the overall goals of the organization. A clear theory     of change helps staff make strategic choices at every level.We didnât know how to develop a theory of change. But we knew we wanted to be rigorous about it. So we contracted with Ian David Moss, of Fractured Atlas    and Createquity fame, to shepherd us through the process. Besides being brilliant and skilled in this area, Ian came in with an outsiderâs perspective,     which really helped us get out of the mindset of what we THINK we do and shift into what is actually observable and track-able. Hereâs what we did:Ian came to Santa Cruz, interviewed a bunch of staff, and drafted a very rough theory of change based on what he learned about our programming.We did a board/staff retreat where we built theories of change in two directions: UP from our activities to our intended impact, and DOWN from the     intended impact to the activities that fuel it. The âDOWNâ side was the most interesting, because it helped us understand the role we could play in our     desired impactâand the community partners we would need to engage and support to see the impact realized to its fullest.We worked with Ian to revise the theory based on the retreat.Ian did a social psychology literature review to understand the research grounding the connections we made from activities to outcomes to impacts. We     identified areas where the connections were weak and where we have to do more research to ensure that the logic is sound.We developed a final version of the theory in a wonky powerpoint flowchart model.We worked with a fabulous illustrator (Crista Alejandre) to transform the flowchart into an inspiring graphic.We started using the theory of change to focus our programs and partnerships, evaluate our work, and change the way we talk about what we do.Here are some questions for Ian about his side of the experience working with us on this project. Next week, Iâll write about the actual content of the theory of change and how it is starting to impact our organization.When you are working with an organization on a theory of change, how do you sort out the organizations' aspirations from the reality of their current activities?Ian: This is always one of the most challenging (and interesting) parts of the engagement. One of the reasons why I find theories of change valuable as a tool     for this kind of conversation is that they are really good at making the chain of logic â or lack thereof â between an organizationâs activities and goals     really clear. That sets up a process where I map out what I perceive the connections to be, and then I run it by the organization to make sure that Iâm     understanding their thinking correctly. If I spot a place in the logic chain that doesnât make sense to me, all I need to do is ask some probing questions     about it. It could well be that Iâve overlooked something important, in which case Iâll add in whateverâs missing, or it could be that Iâve uncovered     something the organization hasnât thought of, which could spark a much-needed reassessment of what the strategy is or even what the real goal is. (This is     exactly what happened to us at Createquity: our theory of change precipitated a             global rethinking of our entire content and engagement strategy         because we discovered a gap between what we were doing and what our aspirations were.) Either way, the theory of change makes the assumptions embedded in a     strategy transparent to everyone and provides a way to put those assumptions to the test. In our work together, we ended up looking primarily to social psychology research to develop a strong logical basis for the MAHâs theory of change.         Do you often find that these projects take you outside of the âartsâ field in terms of defining the logic that connects activities to outcomes to         impacts?     It depends. I would definitely say that you guys are unusual in how you see non-arts and non-humanities research and practices as not just relevant but     central to your work at the museum. But Iâd venture to say that itâs a rare arts organization that canât learn something from how things are done in the     wider world, whether that means understanding how and why potential audience members are motivated to make the choices they do, or understanding the policy     context for the community-level changes youâre hoping to see, or whatever. I think a very common mistake people make is to draw the frame too narrowly, to     say âwell, we donât have any data on this exact thing that weâre looking for, so thereâs no point in trying to answer that question.â The reality is that     we have many tools to understand and to estimate the way the world works around us, and there are a lot of parallels and inferences to be drawn either from     examples in analogous fields or from initiatives that have a general focus that includes the arts but isnât specific to them. What do you think is the most challenging part of developing a theory of change?Different projects present different challenges, but one thing Iâve found to be consistent is that the theory of change process can end up drawing out     major differences in thinking styles. Thereâs a certain type of person whoâs really comfortable breaking ideas down into orderly, modular components and     analyzing the connections between them. Then there are other folks who are not at all accustomed to thinking that way â theyâre much more at home in an     open-ended, anything-goes brainstorming session that encourages divergent thinking and untethered creativity. For those people, the process of creating a     theory of change or logic model can very easily feel confining if you donât set it up carefully. What Iâve found is that things go better if I make sure     that nobody has unrealistic expectations placed upon them. A lot of people find it easier to have a conversation and then react to a model presented to     them than be tasked with having to figure everything out themselves. On the other hand, other folks want to be super involved and thatâs great too. Any words of wisdom about how to build buy-in and encourage use once a theory of change is developed?A really good way to do this is to include it in training materials for both current and new staff. The more that the theory of change gets talked about,     the more likely it is to be used. You can also use it as a reference point for other institutional capacity-building things your organization is doing. So     the MAH used it as the basis for a measurement framework for the organization. At Fractured Atlas, it was a key input for a new brand book we developed to     guide our internal and external communications. It can be an attachment to grant applications or included in annual reports to donors. And itâs important     that the theory of change be periodically revisited to make sure that it doesnât reflect stale thinking. That all being said, I would emphasize that going     into the process with the intention for a theory of change to be useful is the number one predictor of whether it will actually be useful. Furthermore, the     best way to build buy-in for a theory of change is by giving people a voice in creating it. Thatâs why as much as possible I try to involve front-line     staff as well as leadership in the process, so that it will feel resonant at all levels of the organization.
