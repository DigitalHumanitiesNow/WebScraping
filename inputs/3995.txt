In December theÂ Blake Archive opened a new “wing” <http://bq.blakearchive.org> dedicated to back issues of theÂ Blake Quarterly journal (the archive and quarterly have an editor in common, Morris Eaves, so it’s a natural marriage). The first installment covers issues from 2000-09, presented inÂ both HTML and PDF versions.  This is a huge step toward making the journal more accessible;Â previously the hard copy issuesÂ (those produced beforeÂ we went online in 2011)Â were available only from a library or from meÂ at the journal office. It’s also testament to the hard work of many peopleÂ at UNC Chapel Hill;Â I remember sendingÂ a huge box of issues for scanning about 5 years ago, and ever since a number of archive assistants have worked steadily on replacing grayscale images with color images from the archive, tagging, and checking. All kinds of thorny questions ariseâshouldÂ a mistake in the journalÂ be corrected or left as is? If an image of a commercial engravingÂ is from one institution and the archive has an image from another source, is a substitution acceptable, and how should it be noted?Â Like many archive projects, it’sÂ exacting and challengingÂ work on a large scale. I cannot claim any creditâmy contribution ended more or less the day that I manhandled the box of issues to UPS (though that was a feat in itself). Those issues came from the collection in our basement storeroom (at left), which is hot in summer and absolutely roasting in winter, as heating pipes run nearby. Everything has beenÂ covered in a film of white dust since aÂ ceilingÂ tile fell and shattered a while ago (I was assured that it didn’t contain asbestos, so that’s something). So between the heat and the dust and the undulatingÂ shelves and the silverfish it’s the not-so-perfect place for archiving back issues. My hope is thatÂ eventually we will no longer need this room because the contents of all the print back issues will beÂ availableÂ in the archive. But then I’d have to clear it out, so maybe not too soon!
