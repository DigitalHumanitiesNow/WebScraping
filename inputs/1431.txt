Besides wanting to create a post with a title like Kubrick's greatest film, I have also been inspired by Kristine Brorson's post on Networking. Brorson has devoted a category in her weblog to her journey through the world of networking in academia. Like her (more likely, worse than her), I have had trouble networking in the history profession. I've been working on a few publications, the largest of which are two chapters in a new version of The History Highway, but I haven't given many conference papers, and rarely do I talk to anyone when I attend professional conferences. I think I'll start a category on networking like Brorson will hopefully force myself into pursuing opportunities to network and discuss my experience with networking.
