Bill Turkel kindly tagged me with the "Thinking Blogger" award. Two. Months. Ago. Yes, I'm just now getting around to doing this. I'd certainly tag Bill back with this award, but I don't think that's in the rules. Anyways, Bill, you make me think. But you probably already knew that.  I took Clio 2 from Paula Petrik during the Spring 2004 academic semester. (Here's the Spring 2004 course site; here's the Spring 2007 course site.) It was the first time that she taught web design using CSS, and I loved every minute of it. I was still very new to it, but absorbed every technique I could find, read every discussion on CSS browser bugs I could find, and spent countless hours learning new things about Photoshop, video games, and plain old semantic HTML (now called POSH). Now, three years later, Paula's class is lightyears ahead of me when I took that class, and I learn news things from reading their blogs and following their journey through (more or less) the same assignments (and road bumps) that I encountered a few years ago. They help me think about things I never thought about when I took the class, and certainly motivate me to keep up my skills and continue learning.  So, I give the "Thinking Blogger Award" to students in this semester's Clio 2 class:  De-Constructing History 2.0 Digital Design for History Digital History Black Hole Fire When Ready!
