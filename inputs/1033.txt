Apparently, I can't count or read, or I'm dyslexic. I've edited this to start on the fifth sentence, not the third, and to show only three sentences, not five!  I've been tagged by Josh. Here it goes:  1. Grab the book closest to you  Interestingly enough, I was reading a book about the web (among other things), so the book was in my hand when I got Josh's tag.  2. Open to page 123, go down to the fifth sentence  Mmmkay...  3. Post the text of next 3 sentences on your blog  In other words, the associations are not the work of an individual consciousness, but rather the sum total of thousands and thousands of individual decisions, a guide to the Web created by following an unimaginable number of footprints.  It's an intoxicating idea, and strangely fitting. After all, a guide to the entire Web should be more than just a collection of hand-crafted ratings.  Name the book and the author  Steven Johnson, Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software (New York: Scribner, 2001)  I tag Sheila, Amanda, and Tom.
