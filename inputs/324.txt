While working on the grant proposal for the Catalogue of Digitized Medieval Manuscripts, I came across this gem. I have a soft spot for the Commodore 64, and water-color memories of tape drives, of upgrading to a single 1541 disk drive, of saving up hundreds of dollars for the wholly indulgent second disk drive. Â So, whoever is out there browsing the web on a C64 (emulator, I would guess, but that diminishes the drama somewhat), and moreover browsing the Catalogue: cheers.
