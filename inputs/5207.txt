I'm sure most users of Gephi have had moments where they stumble across incredible visualizations that make no apparent sense. I have found the most spectacular failures often to give the most jaw-dropping results:This is a graph mapping grammatical similarities between 4000 random Russian news articles; links in gold occurred at election time, while dark red are all other articles. It seems to form a single long chain of connectivity that makes no sense, apart from on a grammatical level, and even there the links are pretty spurious.
