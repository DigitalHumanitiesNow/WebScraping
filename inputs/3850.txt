Webb opened her talk Monday at Knight’s Media Learning Seminar acknowledging that common reaction – and proceeded to make her point: She demonstrated Crystal, a new web app that predicts personality traits based on a person’s web footprint. Some in the audience squirmed.  	Perhaps they aren’t for everyone, but then many of Webb's tech trends to watch are already impacting the way we consume information.
