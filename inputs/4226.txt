By now, you have likely heard about Genius.com, born as Rap Genius, a platform to "Annotate the world," as the siteâs home page boldly declares. With over $50 million in venture capital funding, the platformâs reach now extends into news, history, law, and even literature. Geniusâs founders want it to be the primary platform for annotation of any page on the web. It is, therefore, crucially important that we understand the risks involved should Genius succeed in its mission. Given the status of annotation as what John Unsworth calls a "scholarly primitive,"1 the high profile of Genius might be a boon to digital annotation by showing to its users that annotation is both important and potentially fun.There are, however, several problems with Genius that I will analyze in this series of posts. (Full disclosure: I am the Director of Technology for an annotation platform called Lacuna Stories.) The first and most fundamental problem, which I will focus on in this first part of the series, derives from assumptions about the nature of collated and synthesized knowledge production as modeled by Wikipedia, a model that does not match the long tradition of annotations.Like Wikipedia, Genius assumes that collaboratively-authored annotations can lead to a stable, monolithic truth about a text, a kind of crowdsourced exegesis. This model fails to respect the possibilities of divergent readings and collapses ambiguity into single narratives authored via consensus. Online consensus, however, often reinscribes the worst biases and inequalities of contemporary society while allowing its worst actors to hide behind pseudonyms and sockpuppet accounts. The idea of an objective, unbiased crowd is fiction.Although this post is not primarily concerned with Wikipedia, an examination of the platformâs history and norms provides a model for understanding, more broadly, the challenges inherent in crowd-sourced knowledge via consensus. I will then discuss how these challenges play out on Genius.Bias on WikipediaWikipedia has been in the news lately because it has become a battleground over gender bias. For background, I recommend Wikipediaâs own page about the problem and Adrianne Wadewitzâs discussion on HASTAC; thereâs also a great deal more discussion about Wikipedia on HASTAC. Most recently, an edit war took place on pages that intersected the Gamergate controversy, which Caitlin Dewey summarizes:Anti-Gamergaters claimed that their sworn enemies were "weaponizing Wikipedia" to promote a misogynist agenda and slander women in the gaming industry. Pro-Gamergaters identified five feminist Wikipedia editors whom they accused of bias and wanted driven off the site. Both sides alleged that organized factions plotted how to manipulate Wikipedia off-site, and then dove into the encyclopedia to carry out their ideological campaigns.Despite Wikipediaâs bemoaned labyrinth of rules (which, really, are not that bad once you read them), the recent Gamergate arbitration decision shows that, at least, the community has some methods for self-correction. Even though the Guardian reported that feminists were being banned "en bloc" (an article of which I was myself guilty of tweeting), the actual details of the case demonstrate that the process can work as it was designed: to enforce the rules governing the process of editing. These rules are critical to an analysis of how online communities form around and through platforms.2As one recent study has found, fears of gender bias on Wikipedia are not unfounded: "while women on Wikipedia are covered and featured well in many Wikipedia language editions, the way women are portrayed starkly differs from the way men are portrayed." In particular, the authors found that although women are not underrepresented, they are more likely to be written about in gendered terms that emphasize family, relationships with men, and explicit references to the subjectâs gender.3 In other words, the articles re-inscribe the patriarchal biases of contemporary society in subtle and therefore pernicious ways. Dewey, in her article about Wikipedia and Gamergate, writes: "Perhaps consensus doesnât always work. Maybe even very well-meaning people canât transcend their own inherent, unvoiced biases to the point of absolute objectivity." Indeed.So why are the community history and norms from Wikipedia relevant to digital annotation platforms? One notable difference between Genius and Wikipedia is that the latter strives for "verifiability, not truth." Wikipedia, in fact, has a wealth of information about the philosophy and principles that guide the siteâs editors; these policies have developed over time based on the experiences of the community. Genius provides no such mission statement or philosophical norms for its users, despite explicitly invoking Wikipedia as a model. Rather than distinguish between "verifiability" and "truth," for example, Genius claims that nature of online annotations are self-evident and arise from debate (i.e., consensus):Annotations are like miniature Wikipedia pages: constantly-improving distillations of the combined wisdom of potentially dozens of scholarsâ¦.Geniusâ¦ is a conversation built around texts and the interpretations of those texts, where you and your Internet-friends debate and converge on good annotationsâ¦.Most annotations on Genius are written by a bunch of different authors whose contributions combine into one big stew of knowledge. (emphases added)Unlike Wikipedia, the leaders of Genius seem not to have considered the nature of knowledge production in any deep way: itâs "one big stew of knowledge" composed of "good annotations," nebulously defined. In a consensus, single narrative format, itâs therefore likely that the knowledge produced will reflect the values of the current hegemony. The Genius CommunityThe critical debate around Wikipedia provides a robust point of comparison with the online community developing around similar digital affordances provided by the Genius platform. Yet even with Wikipediaâs thoughtful rules, detailed processes, and maturity as a project, it still leaves much to be desired as a record of human knowledge. Rather than Arbitration Committees and the "Kafkaesque bureaucracy" David Auerbach ascribes to Wikipedia, Genius has on its "Meta Genius" section a set of "Contributor Guidelines" and a system of editors, moderators, and "regulators" to police annotations.Genius also has an up/down voting system in place for annotations. Presumably, this affordance is another way to improve the quality of annotations, but online voting is, as David A. Banks puts it, "not to highlight the best content, but to build and maintain hegemony." In other words, a simplistic up/down voting system is a naive way to manage a community of annotators. Banks continues:By ignoring the existence of other subjectivities online, these sites [like Reddit] reproduce (as bell hooks would call it) the imperialist white supremacist capitalist patriarchy. Implementing voting in online forums, evidence suggests, is a good way to keep them white and full of dudes. Hegemonic online voting systems are not useful mechanisms for the creation of equitable online communities, which is a prerequisite for more nuanced and sophisticated collaborative textual interpretation.Most of the content on the "Meta Genius" section, however, is devoted to how one might use Genius and various materials promoting the platform, rather than lengthy guidelines. The first of the "Dos and Donât" in the guidelines is "Do say something interesting." But interesting to whom? A subjective judgment that an annotation is "interesting" means that the communityâs biases will again be reflected. Therefore, we must ask: is the Genius community like most others on the Internet? Is it young, white, straight males? The answer is "yes." According to survey results of approximately 240 users, over 90% of the site users are male. Just under 80% are 20 years old or younger. Around 87% are heterosexual. 86% lack a college degree (no doubt an artifact of the incredibly young age of the survey respondents). The top two races are white (58%) and black (17%). According to an annotation of the racial breakdown, this better-than-average racial diversity nevertheless became whiter since 2013. Itâs clear from the survey and what we already know about the typical user of sites like Wikipedia and Reddit that, on Genius, "something interesting" can be read as "something interesting to young, straight, white males."To see if I could find evidence of bias caused by the demographics of this community, I decided to look at annotations of particularly misogynistic rap lyrics, beginning with Eminemâs song "Kim." The song, which ends with the narrated murder of the rapperâs ex-wife, has an annotation to contextualize the entire song:This is hands down Eminemâs most controversial song. That has overshadowed much of its nuance.Itâs tough to look past the graphic violence. Most people assume this is an angry revenge fantasy. Eminem verbalizing what he would do to his ex-wife if he could get away with it.Thatâs a huge part of whatâs going on. The rage is authentic. But as with much of Eminemâs art, you canât take it at face value. What heâs really trying to communicate comes out in, e.g.: Oh my God, I love you. Itâs a strangled scream. (emphasis added)Whew! What a relief! I was afraid the song was about his tendencies towards domestic abuse. Thanks to this annotation, I now realize that itâs just his way of showing love. Itâs hard to imagine an annotation more in line with apologists for the patriarchy than this one, yet itâs been upvoted six times as a "good annotation" and has been worked on by seven different contributors. The three introductory paragraphs, which excuse the lyrics as a nuanced, artistic expression of love that we "canât take at face value," were, moreover, the first contribution. The rest of the contributions simply provided additional references.For comparison, we can look at the Wikipedia article on "Kim." Thanks to the emphasis on neutral point of view and verifiability, this article includes excerpts from the critical reception of the song that call it "a shout-rapped enactment of domestic violence so real it chills." Even though Bryce Peake has trenchantly criticized Wikipedia for promulgating a "misogynistic infopolitics" that show the community of editors and the siteâs content are far from objective, particularly when it comes to gender politics, Wikipedia at least provides a way for concerned editors to include conflicting views while keeping edits away from interpretation as much as possible. Hence, the Wiki article on "Kim" provides readers a sense that this song has troubled many people. The Genius annotation, on the other hand, begins with an apology that identifies with the point of view of the songâs narrator, offers no real recognition of other reactions to the song, and masks a misogynistic interpretation as straight-forward explanation.ConclusionSadly, none of this is surprising. From what we know about how bias creeps into Wikipedia despite detailed guidelines and a much, much larger community of contributors, we can predict with depressing accuracy the existence of systematic bias in Genius annotations that reflect the perspectives of its user base. For a site that "aspires to be a place where everyone feels welcome and safe" so that they can "promote human understanding by annotating the world," thereâs very little indication that the companyâs leaders have an understanding of what is really required. Wikipediaâs increasingly high profile cases of gender bias in the creation and maintenance of articles, their categorization, and various edit wars attest that digital platforms, particularly those that direct users towards a single narrative, only re-inscribe existing inequalities of current society. There is no reason to assume that Genius will do any better.How appropriate, then, is Genius as a platform for learning or for discussing and interpreting literature? With a reported 3-4 million unique visitors per month, many people may first encounter lyrics, news, or literature on a platform that places equalâor greaterâvalue on crowd-sourced interpretations of the text, potentially more than the text itself. Imagine reading Lolita for the first time where it is littered with typical responses to the novel from a naive reader: apologetics for Humbert Humbert.4 (Remember, Vanity Fair called this novel "the only convincing love story of our time.")My fundamental concern about Genius moving from a "fun tool" toâif their aspirations are realizedâthe "Talmud of the Internet" is that its communityâs interpretations could become the first encounter for many people seeking narratives about humanity and the human experience. I'll examine as a case study the role of annotating literature in the humanities classroom to see how these issues play out at a micro-scale in my next post: The Problems with Genius, Part Two: Annotating Literature in the Classroom.UPDATE on 4/29/15: This post has been annotated via Hypothes.is.Notes1 The others are Discovering, Comparing, Referring, Sampling, Illustrating, and Representing.2 For an analysis of how Wikipediaâs rules are used as weapons to maintain hegemony, see: Peake, Bryce.
