   <p>Iâve been thinking a lot lately about the purpose(s) of formal education, especially public education. Itâs not that I havenât thought about it before! But because of some writing projects, and some committee work at CU, I want to articulate an exhaustive, concise vision of the purpose of education.</p>  <p>Iâve come up with five overarching purposes of formal public education:</p>  <ul>   <li>Intellectual and cognitive formation  </li>   <li>Social formation  </li>   <li>Critically minded agency  </li>   <li>Social mobility  </li>   <li>Workforce preparation  </li> </ul>  <p>(Yes, I do think that workforce preparation should be part of the purpose of formal schooling. But I did list it last for a reason.)</p>  <p>What do I have wrong? What am I missing? And should every stage/aspect of education address all five? (I donât think so.)</p>  <p><em>Note: you can reply below, or you can reply to my tweet or Facebook post.
