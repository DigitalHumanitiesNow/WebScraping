The end of July saw our final symposium on the history of news – three days of papers, discussion and of course the best news-themed cakes. You can get a breakdown of the days’ events through our Storify, aimed at preserving the discussion, recapping the day and pooling useful links; as Cultures of Knowledge (@cofktweets) tweeted: ‘like a conference report, but a real-time, living, collaborative one. And with more cakes’. Email me if you’d like to add more links to resources mentioned in your paper, or additional comments.
