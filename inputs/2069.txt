1,500 Greek and Latin inscriptions survive from Roman Cyrenaica (modern Libya).         A project to produce a digital publication of these texts is currently in progress at Kingâ€™s College London,         in association with colleagues in Libya, Italy and the U.S.A. (http://ircyr.kcl.ac.uk/).   This paper discusses         the issues surrounding the markup of these texts in EpiDoc XML and the possibilities of associating         archaeological data with the epigraphic material.
