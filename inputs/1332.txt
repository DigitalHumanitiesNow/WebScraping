I meant to post this a few months ago but left it sitting in my drafts box. Chicago Public Radio has a interesting series of programs on the history of the senses. From the website:  The senses--hearing, taste, smell, touch, and sight--guide us through our daily interactions in the world. The way our senses operate is often described in biological terms. But the senses have a social history as well. Ideas about how the senses function and how they serve us, have evolved over time and shape the way we interpret the information our senses collect. What forces--social, technological, cultural--affect the way we think about our senses? Over five consecutive Tuesdays, Odyssey examines each of the senses. Each program in the series highlights one sense and explores some of the meanings we apply to it.  The May 31 show on smell is my favorite so far. William Cohen and Mark Smith are guests. Smith has written and edited a few books on sound in history, including Listening to Nineteenth-Century America. Cohen has recently edited a collection of essays entitled Filth: Dirt, Disgust, and Modern Life, which is quite good.  What I don't like is that they're in RealAudio format. It's fine to listen to on the computer, but I want to convert them to MP3 and listen to them on my iPod. Any suggestions on how best to convert RealAudio into MP3?
