Rafael Alvarado, AssoÂ­ciate DirecÂ­tor of SHANTI at the UniÂ­verÂ­sity of VirÂ­ginia, has written a blog posting titled " The Digital Humanities Situation."  Alvarado argues that there is no definition of DH.  Instead "we have a genealÂ­ogy, a netÂ­work of famÂ­ily resemÂ­blances among  proÂ­viÂ­sional schools of thought, methodÂ­ologÂ­iÂ­cal interÂ­ests, and  preÂ­ferred tools, a hisÂ­tory of peoÂ­ple who have choÂ­sen to call  themÂ­selves digÂ­iÂ­tal humanÂ­ists and who in the process of tryÂ­ing to  define the term are creÂ­atÂ­ing that defÂ­iÂ­nÂ­iÂ­tion....It is a social catÂ­eÂ­gory, not an ontoÂ­logÂ­iÂ­cal one."
