I'm coming up for a bit of air as I'm working on my minor field research, my documentary, two different conference papers, two chapters for a book, and work. I'm a big U-2 fan, and it's rare that I find good covers of their songs. But this one is great. And, its available for download here:  "Sunday Bloody Sunday" by RX.  The songs uses George W. Bush's voice somehow to sing the song. The best line is near the end of the song:  anyone who wants more details on my agenda can find them online  the web address is not very imaginative but its easy to remember  thepartyparty.com.
