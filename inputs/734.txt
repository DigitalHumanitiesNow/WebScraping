Jane Austen, Game Theorist Game theoryâthe study of how people make choices while interacting with othersâis one of the most popular technical approaches in social science today. But I argue that Jane Austen explored game theoryâs core ideas in her six novels roughly two hundred years ago.Â  I find that game theory has early and subversive historical roots in Austenâs novels and in âfolk game theoryâ traditions, including African American folktales.Â  I consider how Austen analyzed âcluelessnessââthe conspicuous absence of strategic thinkingâand how her observations apply to U.S. military blunders in Iraq and Vietnam.
