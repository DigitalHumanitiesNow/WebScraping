 I finished installing a dual boot system on my mid-2007 White Macbook. The process was not that difficult and I’ve yet to find a real problem with the Ubuntu OS. I was able to do this by following these steps: Going to this page: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MactelSupportTeam/AppleIntelInstallation and following the instructions under the heading “Dual-Boot: Mac OSX and Ubuntu” My rEFIT partition table step froze and gave me “GPT partition of type ‘Unknown’ found, will not touch this disk”, so I had to go to: http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=11215214&postcount=185 and followed the instructions exactly. I also completed step #9 from the above page to get rid of the annoying 30 sec delay when Ubuntu was attempting to load from the rEFIT bootloader. Last, I did need to restart the machine twice before the Ubuntu OS successfully loaded from rEFIT bootloader. It seems to be running smoothly now and I have a nice dual boot system running quite fast on a relatively old Apple White Macbook I’m using the Ubuntu OS to run a development LAMP server which includes TOMCAT. I know I can run a similar setup on OSX, but I like keeping them separate and having the experience of working with Ubuntu and all the open-source software.  With this boot I can develop both for my course instruction and for the Chymistry of Isaac Newton Project. FTW! NOTE: Â Installing LAMP server and TOMCAT is a breezeÂ in Ubuntu 11.01. Â Go to: Â http://www.unixmen.com/install-lamp-with-1-command-in-ubuntu-1010-maverick-meerkat/Â and follow the instructions.
