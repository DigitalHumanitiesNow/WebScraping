I just posted to the VersatilePhD Forum, but I’d love to have your help getting the word out as well. I’m interested in starting a VersatilePhD meetup in the Greater Boston area, to get together and brainstorm Ac, Alt-Ac, Post-Ac, Non-Ac and any “ACK!” we find to discuss! I know this is an idea that is relevant to many of your interests! If you hold or are working for a PhD and hold or think you may at any point hold a job other than a tenure-track academic position, this group is for you. You don’t have to have graduated to join. You don’t have to be outside academia. Just come and share (that’s give AND receive) knowledge and insight! I have set up a doodle poll to find the best time. Please feel free to forward this link: http://doodle.com/r8zygsytwpwe2uzmÂ So I can communicate with folks ahead of time, please ALSOÂ send me an email at VersatilePhD @ PhDeviate.org. Please forward wildly!
