Flickr BetchaboyI'm not sure how many "Back to Blogging" type posts I have written, but I am sure it is a lot. I find myself going through periods of blogging where I am quit prolific and other times when there is nothing I want to say. The past 6 months of my life have been some of the toughest I have gone through both personally and professionally. I knew that if I blogged it would just end up being something negative. But now I have some perspective, and as a teacher I amÂ reflective, so now is the time to start writing again. I got back into twitter, started posting comments on other blogs and am finding my voice again. So with renewed energy - I start again. Wish me luck....
