When I first moved to Montreal in 2004, people would tell me they were going to “London” and I’d get excited for them because I thought they were going to the UK. Â Then they’d say “London, Ontario” and it would be slightly disappointing. Â Nine years later, last night, I’m checking in at the airport to fly to London, Ontario for the first time and the woman says to me “can I see your passport?” Â When I explain it’s Ontario, she said “oh, sorry” and gave me a disappointed look. Some cosmic loop has just closed.
