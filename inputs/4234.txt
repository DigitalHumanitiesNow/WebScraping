I published my first e-book the other day. So, if you have a kindle, iPhone or iPad, you can purchase it for $3:99 at any amazon store. The book is called James Joyce and Zurich's Fair City - And other historical reflections on Switzerland..It collects a number of published and unpublished essays and, as the blurb says "offers a series of anecdotal historical essays that will enhance your stay in Switzerland's beautiful city of Zurich. Stagger in the footsteps of James Joyce, drop in at the zany Cabaret Voltaire, get to grips with the philosophy behind Wagner's operas, discover Zurich's connections with Tom Waits, Thomas Mann, Will Self, Herman Hesse, Empress Sissi and many more.Get you copy at this link now before it sells out!
