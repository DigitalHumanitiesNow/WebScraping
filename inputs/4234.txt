With the recent introduction of Facebook Graph Search, the fact that the data we provide Facebook situates us in a navigable, analyzable network has become clearer than ever. When I came across this tutorial that explains how to extract one's social network data from the site (here's another one as slides), I jumped on the chance and produced these results in Gephi: What I found fit my expectations, for the most part, but also made visible some distinct features of friendship networks (at least, as they exist on Facebook). There seems to be one recurring structure: the deeply interconnected network that, when graphed, looks like a circle.I found this structure (or areas in my network that would look like this with more nodes) throughout my graph. What does it mean? Simply that mutual friends on Facebook tend to all be have one another also as friends.What these graphsâand networks of people in generalâfail to capture are the emotional ties among people. It's one thing to share many mutual friends, but such facts say almost nothing about the quality of the actual friendships involved. For example, I have a small network of my oldest and dearest friends. They do cluster in my graph near one another, but several other people also appear in that sub-network who are little more than acquaintances. Yet there's no way to distinguish them in the graph. Certainly, I could weight edges by âemotional attachmentâ (if that can be quantified) and adjust the graph accordingly, but I suspect that the overall structure would be unlikely to change much. My immediate family network is almost indistinguishable from the network of people who were in high school marching band with me (I played the saxophone, btw), but clearly their importance in my ârealâ social network differs radically.This objection is not controversial; indeed, it's simple to say, âtrue, but so what? Network graphs have limitations, too.â But this experiment on my friendsâand again, Facebook forces every individual into that one categoryâhas made clear some of what isn't captured by this type of visualization: the very kind of information humanists are often most interested in investigating. One of the least dense areas of my network holds my closest friends; my wife is barely distinguishable from my in-laws; and people with whom I have almost no regular contact look the same in this graph as anyone else.As a further experiment, I broke the larger network graph into smaller communities, posted them on Facebook, and tagged every person whose name appeared. The responses were telling. Of my friends in graduate school, many commented and found the graph fun to interpret. Distant acquaintences from high school made no comments at all (this group is mostly some of the âcool kidsâ with whom I had little regular contact even back then). Family made a few remarks. There seemed to be a algorithm determining who would respond that combined the closeness of our relationship, the friend's academic status (my academic friends made far more comments than anyone else), and the density of the commenting friend's connections with the others tagged. I have no grand conclusions to draw from this experiment, but I found it a fun way to explore this social network.
