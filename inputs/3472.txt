 The interactive infographic Where We Came From, State by State [nytimes.com] by Gregor Aisch, Robert Gebeloff and Kevin Quely reveals how US citizens have moved between different US states since the year 1900.   The migration data is based on Census data, which was used to compare the state of residence versus the state of birth of a representative sample of Census forms. The visualization technique resembles that of organically shaped, stacked area graphs, also coined as stream graphs or ThemeRiver.
