Omeka 2.3, out today, includes improvements throughout the system, as well as a number of bug fixes. This release includes improved accessibility, with better labels, skip navigation links, and the addition of ARIA roles and landmarks . We have also added the ability to use PHP’s GD extension for creating file derivatives when uploading. This is in addition to the options to use either PHP’s Imagick extension, or the default external imagemagick. This should allow easier setup on some servers. Read more about configuring thumbnail creation here. Another change is that the drop-down menu in advanced search for ânarrow by specific fieldâ now sorts the fields in the same order that you have arranged them, rather than sorting alphabetically, making it easier to find the fields you use most when searching. There are a large number of bug fixes for this release, including issues with assigning tags, some tags being treated as case-sensitive, fixes to some upgrade errors, resolving an issue with multiple text inputs and advanced search, display of item search filters, theme overrides on plugin views, over-escaping on certain attributes and page titles, and errors which could cause index records to fail. There are also many updates to the existing translations, as well as two new languages, Bulgarian and Korean. Of particular interest to developers, we have added support for newer versions of PHPUnit (4.2+) as well as for the new access control directives used by Apache 2.4. See a list of all the changes in this update in the release notes. Updated Addons The following themes and plugins also have updates to reflect the accessibility improvements, bugfixes, and compatibility with Omeka 2.3.
