We released new version of  ImageMontage free visualization tool (ImageMontage v.2). ImagePlot v.2 DocumentationImagePlot v.2 download  (please use this version, rather than the one on ImageJ website). ImageMontage v.2 - Key Features:- Create high resolution montages of large image collections. For example, you can visualize a collection of 40,000 images (assume each image is 100 x 100 pixels) in a single 20,000 x 20,000 pixel montage.- The images can have different sizes and/or proportions - they will be scaled to the same height in the montage.- The order of images in a montage can be controlled by a user. (Create a text file with a list of file names in a sigle column, and use it as the input in "Image Source" option.) In the examples above, one montage organizes a set Instagram photos by upload date/time; another organizes the same images by average hue. (The plugins which measure image characteristics are included with our ImagePlot plugin.)- You can include all images in a single folder; all images within subfolders; or images located in different areas of your drive ("Image Source" option.)- The new version allows you to create 1-level, 2-level, or 3-level montages. For example, you can organize your photos by year, month, and event. Or, you can montage images of van Gogh painting by city, year, and season. (See examples below).How to run: ImageMontage is a plugin for ImageJ, a popular free open source image analysis software (runs on Mac, PC, Lunix). 1) Download ImageJ software;2) Download ImageMontage v2 plugin from GitHub; 3) In ImageJ: use File > Open to open the plugin file.
