 Originally posted on speakfortoday: If you have time, listen to this. It is an amazing speech. I listen to his words and find that what he says is still relevant to the world we now live in. Many years have passed since his light was extinguished. What he said and what he did remains. So long as we care, the influence of this man and people like him remain. Hearing such powerful words inspires in me both gratefulness and commitment. The world could use the leadership and idealism created by such visionary human beings as this. Notice within the speech there is no triviality, no childish selfishness. He speaks of responsibility and hope. He and many people like him endured the âwrath of their societyâ in order to do what is right. How can we offer any less?     View original
