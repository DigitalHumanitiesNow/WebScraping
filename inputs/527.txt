I’m excited to announce that today we received word that EBBA has been awarded its 5th NEH Collections and Reference Resources Grant. Â Funding from this award will allow us to update the user interface, enhancing both human and machine access to the archive, and to add to the EBBA collection the over 1,100 17th century broadside ballads in the collection of the Houghton Library at Harvard University. Â Thank you to the NEH and to our project partner, Harvard University, for making this next phase of EBBA’s development possible.
