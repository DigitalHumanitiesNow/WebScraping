As some of you may perhaps by off-chance have subtly noticed, there's a soccer craze going on out there. Everyone knows ninjas are awesome soccer players (they're awesome at everything actually, that's why they get to become ninjas), yet we somehow seem to lack this particular ninja gene... But we can hoot and yell like any strappy 40-something ManU fan with an eye-catching extending waistline peaking out from under his jersey and spilling over his Primark training pants, pint in one hand, and, well, pint in the other!Got off to a bad start, missing some of the more spectacular matches due to some time-zone related issues (those poor Japanese: everything's scheduled at truly ungodly hours there), but having to sit through the whole mind-boggingly boring Iran-Nigeria, well I would like to say encounter, but it wasn't even that, but now we're back on track, and, since spaghetti monsters are turning out to be the sole reason of our existence, the enlightenment to our inner Buddha's as it were, we thought it would be neat to construct one in the next couple of weeks.It's a pretty simple graph up till now of course, with only diads since no-one's played more than once yet. It's directed, with winners pointing to losers, and and the weight of the edges resembles the difference in goals. So Netherland-Spain has a weight of 4, while Iran-Nigeria has no edge, since it was a tie. That's all for today, folks! Belgium's playing this evening, so it's time to focus on outfits, make-up, half-time mix tapes, victory dances, ...#cheer4Belgium!PS: calendar's being updated regularly so make sure to check it out once in a while!
