It's been awhile since my last post, but for good reason.  This past Spring, I attended job interviews, accepted a new position, defended my dissertation and graduated, moved to New York state, and created a syllabus for a new class!I'm now the Assistant Professor for Interdisciplinary and Digital Teaching and Scholarship at SUNY New Paltz, and I'm teaching a 19th Century interdisciplinary digital humanities class themed around Sherlock Holmes's London. I'm really looking forward to the semester, which starts on Monday.My primary reason for writing this entry is bittersweet:  now that I have a position as an assistant professor, I want to make my blog double as an academic portfolio, and Wordpress better suits this goal.  As a result, all future posts will be at the new incarnation of "Anglophile in Academia": http://annieswafford.wordpress.com/.  I hope you'll follow me there.Thanks for reading and for your support.
