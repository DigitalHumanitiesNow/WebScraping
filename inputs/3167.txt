  [Slide 1]: Hi, so I want to thank Todd for that great introduction. I also want to thank my committee members Debbie Lee, Patty Ericsson, and Kim ChristenÂ and the rest of the English department for really guiding me through this process. And, most importantly, I thank Leeann for her constant help and love and my kitties Buddha and Nemo. They keep me sane âmostly. The title of my talk is âNineteenth-Century Digital Humanities,â and Iâll get to what exactly that means in a bit. But the purpose of this sketch is to show you the work Iâve done since my hire at WSU in 2012. I also want to mention that Iâve provided a set of quotes on a handout. The first three are quotes from reviews of my first book. The middle five are content-quotes from my talk today, and the final four are just citations of a selection of forthcoming, under review, and in process work. [Slide 2]: I mentioned to Leeann the other day how it is funny the way my work comes into focus only after I actually do it. I didnât really come up with this term âNineteenth-Century Digital Humanities,â until I started my steampunk project. But it it is a good term to encompass my work. The idea is that the digital doesnât refer to a specific technology or modality, but is really any kind of system that can be easily manipulated, copied, remediated, transmitted, or otherwise transposed. I distinguish the âdigitalâ part of my work from my âanalogueâ colleagues by insisting that the nineteenth century isnât only a linear or continuous historical period (though it is certainly that), but is also what Kari Kraus calls an âallographicâ or digital system: it is made up of discrete elements that are adapted and put to use in different ways. This, she contrasts with autographic or analogue technology. For me, autographic technology treats representation as having a kind of continuity with or an indexical relationship to the past.Â  Â [Slide 3]: My work in William Blake and the Digital Humanities also diverges from other digital humanities scholars by calling attention to the singularity of the copy, rather than being concerned with its proximity to some assumed âoriginal.â I suggest that analogue culture is essentially industrial in nature and, as such, effaces differences between copies to reinscribe autographic ideologies: whether they be the aura of the author, the nationalism of literary study, or the consistency of a brand. So, the nineteenth-century is particularly important in my work because it is caught in the middle of an analogue/autographic world: the industrial revolution made standardization more prominent, artisans were de-professionalized because uniqueness in crafting was no longer economically feasible, luddite revolts and labor unrest occurred due to rapid shifts in technology. Thomas Carlyle called the nineteenth century the âMachine Age,â due to all of the âcunning implementsâÂ of the industrial revolution and its âpre-established apparatuses.â By the way you can study digital technology in an analogue manner, by presuming that digital copies are less authentic than analogue media. But to me, to study nineteenth-century digital humanities is to analyze the implications of cultures modifying and transforming these analogue ideologies in a digital age. [Slide 4]: My first book explored how autographic ideology impacts Blake studies by examining variations of Blake from Rosettiâs â quite heavily â editing of Blake for Alexander Gilchristâs 1868 edition of The Life of William Blake to more recent and recognizable digital appropriations like Graham Harwoodâs London.pl (a version of the poem written in the programming language Pearl), Twitter quotes and misquotes referring to Blake, and GIS-enabled maps with video creating Blakean-inspired visionary experiences of London. Overall, we call this Blake a âvirtual Blakeâ drawing off of Deleuzeâs insight that the virtual is not some incomplete version of an actual object or person, but that it frames the way we understand the difference between the original and the copy. [Slide 5]: The book extends this analysis to traditional digital humanities projects like the William Blake Archive. The Blake book argues that differences between the pixels of the Archive and the material of Blakeâs original books really point to a creative tradition in Blake studies that extends throughout the history of his appearances in edited anthologies and collections. In other words, editors and academics are just as creative as literary authors, painters, and musicians. The reception to the book has been generally positive. Laura Mandell wrote a generous ten-page review-essay about the book in Studies in Romanticism, one of a top-tier and oldest journals in the field of British Romanticism. (See Quote 1) Further, you can see that Mark Drexell wrote a great piece for Review19 (Quote 2), an online open access review journal that is frequented by both Romantic and Victorian scholars. My book was also mentioned in Frances Fergusonâs review of new Eighteenth-Century scholarship in SEL: Studies in English Literature and she devoted a paragraph to it. (see Quote 3). [Slide 6]: As you can see, this sense of the nineteenth century as digital media positions all of my work, but I wanted to inflect that idea through some of the more recent phenomena in the digital humanities and the nineteenth century for my second book, that is on maker culture, media archaeology, and steampunk. So, steampunk is interesting because it openly plays with different senses of time. My overall argument is indebted, in part, to Wolfgang Ernst who discusses the time criticality of media devices. According to Ernst, media are not only encapsulated in human-cultural history but they also technologically produce time and history. Ernst explains this in terms of digital media with the way programming loops break symbolic systems into bits, transmit those bits operatively through processors, then return a reassembled symbol as a response. When we look at a clock on our computer screen, we cannot directly physiologically perceive all of the computational transmissions designed to make it read 8:29 (particularly if our clocks are synched via wifi to time-keepers that Apple uses for all of their devices). So, this temporality isnât just symbolic or cultural, its processual and operational. Despite the fact that we do not perceive these flows, we register them and use them to organize our sense of time and â abstracting out â our calendars and, ultimately, the way we write our history. Often, what Ernst calls âmicrotemporalitiesâ of these computational devices are literally disturbed by the lags, syncs, and flows of internet speeds. We are beginning to feel these resonances more acutely because we use all sorts of different media devices everyday: from laptops connected to high speed internet at home, to comparatively slower speeds in some places on campus, to 3g loading on our smartphones. Culturally, though, steampunkâs experiment with alternate history signals a growing awareness of these physiologically imperceptible temporalities, as well as how their registers in computational devices place different people into different flows of temporal experience. [Slide 7] The notion of multiple potential historical experiences allows me to move back to nineteenth century authors and forward into twentieth- and twenty-first novels and digital media. I look pretty closely in my introduction at specific authors who register a temporal disjunction in the nineteenth-century by revolting against the emergence of standardized industrial time. See Quote 5. Blake desires this escape from âSatans watchfiends,â just as he lamented the spread of the âdark satanic mills.â You can see this attitude repeated in the Milton image, where the character is interrupting the temporal flow of the title, physically forcing it and the rest of the text into these striations. William Morris, in The News from Nowhere, See Quote 6 imagines a dystopian space called the World-Market â which presumes an ever-accelerating flow of progressive industrial time, and creates this ravening beast of acceleration. This is eventually replaced with the medievalist utopia of the novel. [Slide 8] So the book moves from these nineteenth century disruptions to twenty-first century steampunk representations of ruptured industrial time. This is a screenshot from the 2011 steampunk game Bioshock Infinte, and you can see the resonance between the Milton image breaking the flow of time and this character Elizabeth tearing into the fabric of space and time. The game, if you donât already know, revolves around your character Booker DeWitt trying to rescue Elizabeth, who is being held against her will by a libertarian religious community that split off from the United States in the 1890s. You find, however, that she can use these tears to venture to alternate histories. This is the first time you see her do it, and sheâs opening a portal to an alternate 1980s France, and the billboard (that you canât see very well) says âRevenge of the Jedi.â Itâs a bit of nostalgic fan-service, because Revenge of the Jedi was the first title before George Lucas changed it to Return of the Jedi. The game does this with a variety of things: there are Easter eggs, for instance of The Beach Boyâs âGod Only Knowsâ sung by âColumbiaâs Gayest [Barbershop] Quartet” and a cover of âGirls Just Wanna Have Funâ that is played on a calliope (musical instrument produces sound through steam through large whistles). The game usesâ in this way â symbols of progressive time (in the form of nostalgic capitalist touchstones like Revenge of the Jedi) to signal a rupture with the temporality in which Bioshock Infinite exists. [Slide 9] This is a bit of a spoiler warning for those of you who havenât yet played the game and donât want to know the ending. I only talk about it for the next slide. [Slide 10] The technology of Bioshock Infinite is created because your enemy Zachary Comstock is using Elizabeth to pull different technologies from the tears she creates and mashes them with the ânormalâ technologies of the Victorian period. Itâs like a technological version of the 80s songs. The weird and fascinating thing about this game is its recursive nature. You find [double spoiler warning] that Comstock and DeWitt are actually the same person from different parallel universes. And that, further, this isnât the first time DeWittâs attempted to rescue Elizabeth. Heâs actually failed 122 times, and created numerous different parallel universes. The game only ends when Elizabeth strangles you. So, Bioshock Infinite really questions this idea of time or history as progressive. In fact, it reveals that the only progression that occurs is the progressive dumping of DeWitt bodies after theyâve failed in their mission to save the day. [Slide 11] My steampunk book is interested in how different interruptions in progressive technological history produce these iterations of the nineteenth century, all of which are politically and culturally positioned to do different things. (Quote 7) is a press release from the startup group Adaptive Path, who appeal to steampunk design in order to deal with the fact that rural users in India (who were called non-literate) didnât adopt the cultural conventions that would allow them to use so-called a so-called normal smartphone interface. The idea of steampunk as a âworkaroundâ is interesting to me, but also entirely condescending in terms of suggesting that design alone can bring these ânon-literateâ people into the progressive world of technological consumption. So, the emphasis here is on technological solutions for cultural difference, using steampunk implicitly to signify a lower degree of technological sophistication, placing the ânon-literateâ in an earlier period of progressive time. And using steampunk to bridge temporal and technological difference (rather than cultural difference). [Slide 12] You see this attitude quite a bit in nineteenth century discourses involving the telegraph. Aaron Worth has observed, for instance, that many cultural anxieties surrounding the management of the British Empire in the Victorian period were understood in terms of communication. The telegraph was supposed to make managing the empire more efficient. You see this phenomenon, for instance, in the characterization of the Morlocks in HG Wellsâs The Time Machine, (See Quote 8) which â despite the fact that they are supposed to be descended from the British and invoke historical fears of evolutionary degeneration, nevertheless have buildings that are described by the traveler as having an âOrientalâ aspect. And further, you quickly find that most of the conflict between the Traveler and the Morlocks is sparked by the fact that he cannot communicate with them (he learns the language of the Eloi) â and theyâre cannibals, which is another great bit of Orientalism for you. Of course, you also find this theme in more contemporary steampunk. Quote 9 is from a really wacky 1979 novel Morlock Night which bizarrely combines a sequel to The Time Machine with the myths of Arthur and Atlantis. [read] Crazy, except if you look at how Arthur is conjoined with imperialism and the âpowerâ of English history in this quote. Here, âbrutishnessâ is understood in terms of a break or interruption of an otherwise linear history held together by British soil and blood. But the second break is, strangely enough, the Morlocks themselves. So: the other becomes that which interrupts the flow of an otherwise powerful and progressive history â as we understand in the novel that it is the Morlocks who have literally stolen the Time Machine and used it to destroy British history. [Slide 13] I contrast this sense of technology and empire, which sees Western society as the center of the world communicating to its margins with the rise of multicultural steampunk â which fractures the Britishness of steampunk and searches for historical alternatives. This is what I call a digital appropriation of Victorian elements that are manipulated into different cultural histories. On the left is Suna Dasi, who says on her website âas a steampunk afficiando, I found myself wishing for more roles occupied by Victorian women in the steampunk fiction I was reading: women who were less hampered by the framework of the society damsel. Being of Indian heritage sparked the desire to see Indian women break out of their mother of pearl cages and into steampunk adventures.â Several steampunk designers look to different historical frames when imagining technology. The top right is an illustration taken from descriptions of submarines in the Shakuna Vimana (a 1700 BCE Sanskrit manuscript that imagines magical flying machines that decimate enemy cities). Indian steampunk is taking inspiration from these sources. On the bottom right is the Asian steampunk designer James Ng, whose exhibited his blueprints for Chinese steampunk airships at numerous different conventions and art exhibitions. So, Iâm making good progress with the steampunk book. Itâs under an advanced contract from Routledge with a due date of March 2016. I have one chapter drafted and am working on two more. [Slide 14] I thought Iâd also mention how the New Faculty Grant I received last summer figures into this research program. My final chapter of the steampunk book is focused on creating a computer using only nineteenth century technological affordances. One way this would become complicated is that the integrated circuit wasnât until the middle of the twentieth century, and makes modern computation possible. So, Iâll have to find â as they say â a workaround that will force me to reconceptualize computational history. The grant is also funding a webinar series that I will be hosting in March and April. This webinar series features a number of prominent scholars in the âcritical makingâ movement in digital humanities and will discuss how critical theory plays into their making methodologies. I hope to parlay my work on the nineteenth century computer into an NEH Digital Humanities Seed Grant. This is all very much in the planning stages, however. [Slide 15] Many of my other projects take up this question of nineteenth-century digital media by either demonstrating the adaptation of the century in contemporary digital culture or by â in the case of this article â extending digital history back before the invention of computation. This is from an edited collection that will be published in April 2015. Here, I show how the issue of what constitutes a critical making methodology currently listed as one of the debates in digital humanities can actually be found in figures like William Blake and the analytical engine programmer Ada Lovelace. My purpose, then, is to show how the linear boosterist histories found in some discourses on DH are not really taking into consideration other parallel histories that are relevant. [Slide 16] My contribution to a steampunk book collection currently under review at U of Minnesota Press also investigates making methodologies, this time in the context of more contemporary steampunk design. I suggest that the ideological work of steampunk gadgets and steampunk baking is implicated in the different worlds (human and non-human) from which their components and parts emerge. My point is that â really â we often investigate technology from the vantage point of the human, rather than understanding, materially, how objects are made. [Slide 17] But this doesnât mean that the human aspect of technological expression is unimportant to my work. My article under review at the journal Rhizomes explores how queer steampunk fans appropriate anachronistic technology in order to resist progressive forms of heteronormative time defined in my essay as familial and technological progression. [Slide 18] And Iâve even come back to my work on Blake for an invited article that Iâm currently writing on that focuses on Blakean responses to maker culture. You can see, for instance, that people are designing puppets that work with the Microsoft Kinect controller and Media Art installations designed to remake Blakean visionary experiences. For those of you who donât know, the Kinect models gestural motions computationally, so these makers translate that motion into the motion of a puppet (modeled after Blakeâs design of the Behemoth). In all, the idea is that these makers associate the act of materiality quite differently than humanist scholars who wish to date a Blake manuscript. Blake isnât an author whose presence one proves by examining a manuscript. For me, Blake is a process one performs by making things. [Slide 19] Very briefly, Iâd like to mention a few things about my teaching. Iâm passionate about using technology to connect students to the past and the future of literature.Â Iâve designed 10 different classes since being hired at WSU, one of which resulted in a publication at the Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy on teaching technologies of reading the nineteenth century. Iâve already been on the committess of a number of graduate students including â this year â chairing a few (which is a very different experience). You can find more information about my teaching in my statement. [Slide 20] These are only a selection of the projects I have going on right now. I simply did not have time to mention all of them adequately in this presentation. But I see my work very much connecting the concerns of nineteenth-century studies with newer forms of technology and communication. By treating the nineteenth century as a digital system, I also want to bring the digital humanities closer to fields like media and cultural studies and provide one way of understanding how the mechanisms of technology interface with our experiences in the social world. Thanks!
