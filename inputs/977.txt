John Cook has kindly invited me to co-chair theÂ Ideas in Mobile Learning Symposium in Bristol. We thought we want a “proper” academic event, but also want to have some fun and challenge some practices. For example, do you also feel slightly amused when someone stands on a pulpit and shows a powerpoint about mobile collaborative learning? So we thought we’ll include a “mobiLearnFest” element in the event, which will take the symposium out to the streets. To make it even more interesting, we’re experimenting with an open review model for this element of the symposium. Deadline is Jan. 5th, for a 1000 word abstract. Oh, and John has also promised (threatened?) to play a live punk rock gig! http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8498  TheÂ Ideas in MobileÂ LearningÂ symposiumÂ invites papers around the broad themes of âinnovation, creativity and sustainabilityâÂ forÂ mobileÂ learning. However, we have a strong preference that papers address at least one of the following three trends of mobileÂ learningÂ state-of-the-art research (click here for details): Focus on new patterns of connected socialÂ learningÂ and work-based practices. Focus on designing for âmobileÂ learningâ at scale. Focus on the boundaries ofÂ learningÂ that the âmâ in m-learningÂ forces us to explore. The symposium is a research off-shoot of the successful workshop âTowards sustainable mobileÂ learningÂ scenariosâ held in Bristol 9th-10thÂ October, 2013. Requested contributions should offer any combination of conceptual, critical, design, empirical, theoretical or experimental work that relates in some way to the symposiumâs broad themes and/or the three trends. Places are limited to 40 participants in order to enable a single track event where engaging, interdisciplinary conversational threads will be centre stage. http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8507 mobiLearnFestÂ is part of the “Ideas in MobileÂ LearningÂ Symposium, 6th – 7th March 2014, Watershed, Bristol UK. It is an experimental, interactive, hands-on, open session which aims to give participants an opportunity to experience the ideas discussed at the Symposium and engage the general public in our conversation. mobiLearnFestÂ will showcase a selected number of mobileÂ learningÂ innovations and studies. Submission and selection of these works is completely open – see details below. mobiLearnFestÂ consists of three phases: Demo sprintÂ selected teams will have 150 seconds to present their work to the Symposium. Mobile experiencesÂ each team will provide a mobileÂ learningÂ experience in the surrounding area, which would offer Symposium participants as well as the general public the oppurtunity to engage with their technology, ideas or research findings. Collaborative reflectionÂ Symposium participants will reconvene to share their experiences, and consider emerging themes and questions.
