The tumultuous energy of this 17th-century soliloquy remains alive with the terrors that follow a deal with the devilFAUSTUS: Ah, Faustus, Now hast thou but one bare hour to live, And then thou must be damnâd perpetually! Stand still, you ever-moving spheres of heaven, That time may cease, and midnight never come; Fair Natureâs eye, rise, rise again, and make Perpetual day; or let this hour be but A year, a month, a week, a natural day, That Faustus may repent and save his soul! O lente, lente currite, noctis equi! The stars move still, time runs, the clock will strike, The devil will come, and Faustus must be damnâd. O, Iâll leap up to my God! â Who pulls me down? â See, see, where Christâs blood streams in the firmament! One drop would save my soul, half a drop: ah, my Christ! â Ah, rend not my heart for naming of my Christ! Yet will I call on him: O, spare me, Lucifer! â Where is it now? âtis gone: and see, where God Stretcheth out his arm, and bends his ireful brows! Mountains and hills, come, come, and fall on me, And hide me from the heavy wrath of God! No, no! Then will I headlong run into the earth: Earth, gape! O, no, it will not harbour me! You stars that reignâd at my nativity, Whose influence hath allotted death and hell, Now draw up Faustus, like a foggy mist. Into the entrails of yon labouring cloud[s], That, when you vomit forth into the air, My limbs may issue from your smoky mouths, So that my soul may but ascend to heaven! [The clock strikes the half-hour.] Ah, half the hour is past! âtwill all be past anon O God, If thou wilt not have mercy on my soul, Yet for Christâs sake, whose blood hath ransomâd me, Impose some end to my incessant pain; Let Faustus live in hell a thousand years, A hundred thousand, and at last be savâd! O, no end is limited to damned souls! Why wert thou not a creature wanting soul? Or why is this immortal that thou hast? Ah, Pythagorasâ metempsychosis, were that true, This soul should fly from me, and I be changâd Unto some brutish beast! all beasts are happy, For, when they die, Their souls are soon dissolvâd in elements; But mine must live still to be plaguâd in hell. Cursâd be the parents that engenderâd me! No, Faustus, curse thyself, curse Lucifer That hath deprivâd thee of the joys of heaven. [The clock strikes twelve.] O, it strikes, it strikes! Now, body, turn to air, Or Lucifer will bear thee quick to hell! [Thunder and lightning.] O soul, be changâd into little water-drops, And fall into the ocean, neâer be found! [Enter DEVILS.] My God, my god, look not so fierce on me! Adders and serpents, let me breathe a while! Ugly hell, gape not! come not, Lucifer! Iâll burn my books! â Ah, Mephistopheles!  (Exeunt DEVILS with FAUSTUS)Last weekâs poem, Sophie Hannahâs Selling His Soul, set me thinking about both the origins and the modern usage of the phrase. The Labour partyâs soul was in the news, after all, post-UK election. Shirley Williams, rising above party politics, claimed democracy had been put up for sale. But I didnât find any accusations, from right, left or centre, of actual soul-selling, let alone satanic barter. Generally speaking, âselling your soulâ in modern usage denotes submission to dull routine or lucrative scam. Deals with the devil are rarely implied, even metaphorically. You can choose wealth and power (and sell democracy) and itâs just about being âaspirationalâ, right? Continue reading...
