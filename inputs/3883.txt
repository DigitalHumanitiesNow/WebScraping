So, over the last two weeks, the students in this senior seminar on the History of the Information Age have worked with me to fill in the broad outlines of the syllabus.  This syllabus, version 2.0, has the discussion topics and the assignments set, though I still need to sit down with the weekly discussion leaders to decide on the readings for the week. The assignments include a variety of ways that, as groups and as individuals, students will contribute to the class timeline set up using the Simile Timline plugin for WordPress.  First they'll work in groups to create the events that go into the timeline (a process we discussed as a class last Thursday), their other assignments (again, suggested and/or modified by the students) are as follows:Part one & two â Select one of the following by September 15.Actually use an early system of communication to convey information (demonstrated to the class)OR describe the process and complications of using such an early system to convey information.  (300-500 words, plus sources, posted to your blog)OR research and discuss the significance of an information technology in the life of a specific individual before 1950.  (300-500 words, plus sources, posted to your blog)OR create an infographic with information about an early system of communication from Parts I or II (with sources, posted to your blog)Individual project â Value is 10% of course gradeTo avoid overlap, each topic must be submitted for approval by September 15.Project due September 29Part three â Create your own advertisement/commercial/print ad related to the history of information to be shared. â Group â 10%Due Thursday, October 13Part four â Make a documentary (5-10 minutes) on topic from this period â Group â 15%Due Thursday, November 10Part five â 5% â Help improve the timeline â Aspect must be preapproved before work starts on it.A) Work on the overall structure/format/presentation of the timeline.B) Pick any point on the timeline to expand on (with research) â Can take form of video, brief, essay, infographic, oral history, etc.Individual, unless a case can be made for group work here.Due the last day of class, December 8.As always, questions, comments, and suggestions are welcome.  I'm excited to see what projects the students come up with as they begin to explore the concepts of historically located information and communication through a variety of tools.
