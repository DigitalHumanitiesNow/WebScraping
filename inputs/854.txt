Richard Lee, Jr., Professor of Philosophy at DePaul University, joins episode 70 of the Digital Dialogue to talk about the teaching and philosophy of Richard Bernstein. Rick has published extensively in Medieval and early modern philosophy, the Frankfurt School, and social and political philosophy. He has published two books, The Force of Reason and the Logic of Force, and Science, the Singular, and the Question of Theology (The New Middle Ages) as well as essays in journals such as Telos, Hobbes Studies, Vivarium, and The Graduate Faculty Philosophy Journal. He forthcoming book is entitled âThinking of Matter.” Rick has been on the Digital Dialogue before, and I invite you to listen to episode 30 on the Logic of Force, where we discussed his work on Hobbesâs materialism. There, I think you will hear some of the inchoate ideas fleshed out further in the forthcoming book. What brings him to the Digital Dialogue this timeÂ is, in fact, precisely what brought us together as friends more than twenty years ago, the teaching and work of Richard J. Bernstein. OnÂ September 26-7, 2014Â a group of Bernstein’sÂ students came together to celebrate his life and work in a conference called Thinking the Plural, organized by Eduardo Mendieta, Chair of Philosophy at Stony Brook, and Marcia Morgan, Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Muhlenberg College. The papers delivered over those two daysÂ will be published in a Festschrift for Bernstein entitled: Thinking the Plural: Richard J. Bernsteinâs Contributions to American Philosophy, co-edited by Marcia Morgan and Jonathan Pickle. We recorded our Digital Dialogue on a Google Hangout on Air, a recording of which you can view below.  In addition, please find the audio version below. We touchedÂ first upon Bernstein’s pedagogical practices, moving then to his pluralism, the question of proximity and distance, concluding with a discussion of Philosophy and Technology. Richard Lee, Jr., Professor of Philosophy at DePaul University, joins Chris Long for episode 70 of the Digital Dialogue to talk about the teaching and philosophy of Richard Bernstein. Rick and I were students of Bernstein in the early 1990's, and although we learned a lot of philosophical content from Dick, mostly what we learned was an open, engaged, and fallibilistic way of doing philosophy in dialogue.
