 I spokeÂ at TheNextWeb 2014 in Amsterdam on April 25th.  Here is a map of the connections among the people who recently tweeted the terms:Â tnwconference OR #TNWEurope OR thenextweb  This is a highly fragmented “Brand” network pattern with several prominent Broadcast hub and spoke structures centered around the most central participants:Â @thenextweb, @ow, @epro, @nicolasfordham, @gcouros, @malchord, @martinsfp, @plagia3, @k5launch, @taxion2. I spokeÂ about how anyone who can make a pie chart can now make these network maps and reports. Interested in a map for a topic important to you?
