Lee Skallerup Bessette and Jarah Moesch join the Digital Dialogue for episode 62 at the 2013 Digital Humanities Conference in Lincoln, Nebraska. Lee, who tweets as @readywriting and writes the College Ready Writing blog for Inside Higher Education, and Jarah, @jarahmoesch, talk about the paper they delivered at #DH2013 entitled Digital Humanities: Egalitarian or the New Elite? Their paper invited us to reflect upon the practices of openness in the Digital Humanities, and challenged us to consider how we are living up to the ideals of inclusivity and access toward which the Digital Humanities have long aspired. The presentation, originally submitted as a panel, was accepted as a "Long Paper" for the conference program and, of the six co-authors of the paper, only Lee and Jarah were able to make the trip to Lincoln. They did a nice job reading sections of the paper authored by others, but I missed the voices that were not there: Liana Silva-Ford, (@literarychica), Roopika Risam (@roopikarisam), Alyssa Stalsberg Canelli (@alyssastalsberg), Tressie McMillian Cottom (@tressiemcphd).Because no one wanted to speak for those who were absent, in episode 62 we focus our attention on the perspectives Lee and Jarah represented, though it is my hope that Liana, Roopika, Alyssa and Tressie will be willing and able to participate in the ongoing discussion here on the Digital Dialogue blog.Digital Dialogue 62: Practicing Openness at DH2013
