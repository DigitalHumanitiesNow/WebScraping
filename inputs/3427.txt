Lizzie:I had an instructor in my master’s program that would just give us our grades online. However, if you wanted to get actual feedback he would gladly meet with you during his office hours. As a student, I really liked this method of getting feedback. I find instructor’s comments quite confusing sometimes. But when you sit with the instructor as they read through the paper and get comments that way, it can lead to conversation and a deeper understanding.

I spend a long time not just leaving line comments on each students’ paper but also providing them with references to their writing guide, complete with page numbers, so they can look up the correct way. Maybe, next semester?

No, seriously, one of these days I will write about how my lesson has been learned (Iâm lying; âone of these daysâ is tomorrow, in conjunction with a new article Iâve got coming out).  AT ANY RATE. Grading Thunderdome canâ¦ View original 638 more words
