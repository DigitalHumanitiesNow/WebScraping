A few weeks ago our beloved national troubadour Sufjan Stevens announced a new album titledÂ Carrie & LowellÂ set to be released on March 31st. This will be his first solo album in five years and my anticipation is quite high. If the official album trailer is any indication, this album will lean more toward folk than electronic music and, for me, that’s a good thing. There are shades of electronic touches in the trailer so I don’t suspect that this will be aÂ Seven SwansÂ redux, but perhaps something more akin toÂ IllinoisÂ than toÂ The Age of Adz. Regardless, I’m excited. With that excitement comes a fresh commitment to writing about music. The plan is to take an as-objective-as-possible look at each of Sufjan’s previous album releases and record my take here. My love for the music of Sufjan Stevens is well documented and ever present so I have no dreams of journalistic disinterestedness, but I’ll do my best. Here’s how the plan will shake out: Feb 3:Â A Sun Came Feb 10:Â Enjoy Your Rabbit Feb 17:Â Michigan Feb 24:Â Seven Swans March 3:Â Illinois March 10:Â The Avalanche / The BQE / All Delighted People March 17:Â The Age of Adz March 24:Â Songs for Christmas / Silver & Gold / Chopped & Scrooged March 31:Â Carrie & Lowell  Check back tomorrow for my look into his first record.
