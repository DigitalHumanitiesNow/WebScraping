In the modeling/hobby realm KitBashing âis a practice whereby a new scale model is created by taking pieces out of commercial kits.â I would imagine that in the digital humanities, the process of KitBashing is equivalent to hacking, remixing, and the Mashup. I am working on a hand-rolled custom theme, but that is several long weeks away as I do have grad work to complete. As such, I am temporarily KitBashing this site using hand-rolled CSS/CSS3 on top of the WP-Framework theme I am currently running. Ultimately, this means that there are/will be things broken and non-functional for awhile in Firefox, Opera (upgrade to Opera 10.51 for increased CSS3 support), Chrome, Safari, and particularly IE (read: IE[vi]L). Thank you in advance for your patience as I KitBash my way toward a new site, and please accept my humble apologies if you have problems or are unable to view particular pages/items on the website.
