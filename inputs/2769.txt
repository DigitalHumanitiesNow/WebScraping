Okay, so I've had this file called emnlp.txt sitting in my home directory since Oct 24 (last modification), and since I want to delete it, I figured I'd post it here first. I know this is super belated, but oh well, if anyone actually reads this blog any more, you're the first to know how I felt 6 months ago. I wonder if I would make the same calls today... :)A Log-Linear Model for Unsupervised Text Normalization (Yi Yang and Jacob Eisenstein)Parsing entire discourses as very long strings: Capturing topic continuity in grounded language learning [TACL] (Minh-Thang Luong, Michael C.
