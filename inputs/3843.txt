I’m down to 10 microsieverts per hour so I’m free to go.  But no public appearances for 3 days as I can’t be near pregnant women and you never know who’s pregnant.  So Carrie’s doing the shopping.  Also, I can’t prepare food for you and you can’t snuggle with my neck for 3 days.  Also for 3 days, in general you should maintain a 3 foot distance from me.  That is all for now.  I’m going to touch the computer to close it.  Thanks to everyone who read and wrote.  Because of you (and possibly because of prednisone) I’m sure this was the Best. Radioiodine. Isolation. Ever.
