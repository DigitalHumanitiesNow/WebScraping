Image of archive from wikipedia photos. This is a sketch of a proposed project I’m working on with Lizette Gurerra. Inspiration: This project draws inspiration from several sources. Â One classic archival assignment is to bring students of history or cultural studies into the archive, randomly assign them a box and ask them to write an essay or construct a historical narrative based on the materials. Â At the same time, there is also a tradition of archivist traveling to classrooms and bringing with them a “trunk” of materials for students to handle and examine. Project Summary: Â The purpose of this project is to facilitate the construction of Â narratives, Â making use of UCLA’s Chicano Studies Research Center archive materials through the creation of virtual boxes that can be explored by educators, students, scholars and community members. Â The narratives created by the âboxâ users would ultimately become part of the archive and the boxesâ history. Project RationaleÂ The ability to work with archival materials in order to research and construct historical narratives has previously been limited to those with the privilege of accessing Â the archive in person. Â These institutions rarely are the same ones designated as “Hispanic serving.” This project would allow educators, students (6-12 as well as college and university students) and community members to Â have the powerful experience of opening an archive box and working with the original materials. How would it work: Â Boxes should be able to both be randomly assigned by teachers and / or users so as to create a sense of surprise and adventure, especially in a classroom situation. Â Yet there should also be the ability to request a box on a specific topic so as to make archival materials accessible to community members and students. Box topic ideas: For this project our focus will be on the Southern California Chicano Movement of the 1960s – 70s. Â Specifically: Blowouts Moratorium Creation of MEChA Race and gender Arts and popular culture (murals, music?) LGBT (Cyclona) Chicano Park Labor (UFW, Justice for Janitors, Francisa Flores, Regeneracion) Literature (Manazar Gamboa) Questions: What platform could we use to build and maintain this site? Thinking about Omeka, but that’s mainly because I heard about it at THATCamp MLA and was fascinated by it. Â Ideas for cool names for the project. Â Possibility for users to add their own narratives (and materials) to the site. Other questions and issues we haven’t even thought of yet. Â Please let us know what you think.
