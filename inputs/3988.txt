Happy New Year, Religion in American History readers. One of my favorite ways to get to know a scholar is to read her syllabi. Syllabi show how scholars put together a whole field. (And probably no text reveals personality as much as the introduction and policies on a syllabus.) Yet unfortunately teaching documents are shared less routinely than our research, so we are much more likely to know a scholarâs books and articles than her syllabi. Following the example of Paul Putzâs regular lists of new books, I intend to start a posting a roundup of syllabi for religious history and religious studies from the past semester from whoever wishes to contribute. So here is a list of past syllabi from people who replied to my entreaties. Only a small number replied this first time, but if you would like to add your syllabus to this list, feel free to leave a link in the comments, or you can e-mail me a document and Iâll add it (lincoln@lincolnmullen.com). Cara Burnidge, âReligions of the Worldâ Christopher Cantwell, âCatholicism in U.S. Historyâ Heath W. Carter, âReligion in American Historyâ and âAmerican Utopiasâ both at his teaching page. Jonathan Den Hartog, âReligion in American Historyâ Seth Dowland, âIslam in Americaâ Sharon Leon, âAmerican Religious History after 1865â Lincoln Mullen, âChurch and State in Americaâ John Turner, âMormonismâ N.B. The following syllabi have been added since this post was first published: Michael J. Altman, âEmpire and the Construction of Religionâ David Krueger, âReligion in American Cultureâ Daniel Silliman, âHistory of American Atheismâ Cassandra Yacovazzi, âHistory of American Religionâ
