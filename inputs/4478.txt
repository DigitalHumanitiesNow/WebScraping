I’m giving a talk next Friday (5/22) on literature and economic geography as part of Richard Jean So and Hoyt Long’s Cultural Analytics conference at Chicago. (Talking econ at Chicago. That’s not terrifying at all!) The list of speakers is really impressive, present company excluded. If you’re in or near Chicago, hope to see you there. My talk will be closely related to my recent lecture at Kansas, video of which is available on YouTube (and embedded below). There’s also some enlightening discussion on Facebook; you might need to be friends with Richard So to see it, but you should be friends with him anyway … Looking forward to seeing folks in Chicago!
