I have finally be granted a six month research leave and I am now totally immerse int he writing of The Book.One of the things I am reflecting upon is the weight we give to documentary evidences in textual scholarship. The graph below shows in a simplified (and utterly imprecise) way the collocation of some most important editorial theories with respect to the centrality they give to the documentary evidence (the materiality of the text).Similarly, editorial format can be equally distributed on a continuous line While presenting a very complex reality of theoretical positions in an over simplistic way, these graphs have the advantage of showing the path between text and document as a continuum, with no clearly defined boundaries.  The collocation is not scientifically wighted, it is just the approximate collocation I would give to them. Comments?
