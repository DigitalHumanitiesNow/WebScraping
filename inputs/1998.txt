The Hellespont Project as a case study integrates metadata of archaeological objects from the Arachne and Perseus databases based on the CIDOC CRM (CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model) with the content of Thucydides 1.89-1.118 as well as related secondary literature automatically extracted from JSTOR. In the presentation we want to show how the user will access the interface for Hellespont Linked Data, which - as one main part of the project - is currently still being implemented. The other part of the project is embodied by the so called GapVis for Hellespont, a text-based interface where it is possible to navigate alongside the text of Thucydides with different views on all places, persons and organisations for each text passage and connected information. The connection between the Linked Data interface, GapVis, and also the links back to Arachne and Perseus as well the technologies behind are discussed in the second part of the paper.
