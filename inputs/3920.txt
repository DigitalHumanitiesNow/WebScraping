Below is a copy of the official posting from the Digital Library Federation (DLF).Â  We encourage people to apply and come to the DLF Forum, which is a fabulous venue and community for collaboration on digital libraries, digital humanities, digital scholarship, digital preservation, data, and so much more! DLF is committed to bringing new voices and perspectives to the Forum. To this end, we offerÂ fellowships and travel awards to assist individuals who would not otherwise be able to participate in the Forum. Up to 15 fellows and travel award winners will receive travel assistance and complimentary Forum registration. DLF Forum 2015 Fellowships and Travel Awards ARL + DLF Forum Fellowships for Underrepresented Groups This fellowship is for digital library, museum, or archive practitioners fromÂ traditionally underrepresented groups including, but not limited to, people of Hispanic or Latino, Black or African-American, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, or American Indian or Alaskan Native descent. DLF Forum Fellowships for Students and New Professionals Newcomers to the profession and students at DLF member institutions whose work relates toÂ digital libraries are eligible for this fellowship. DLF Forum Museum Cross-Pollinator Fellowships This fellowship is forÂ practicing museum professionals seeking more exposure on the trends in digital libraries. Priority will be given to applicants who work in art museums. DLF + ER&L Cross-Pollinator Travel Awards The goal of these travel awards is to bring cross-pollinators from the ER&L communityâlibrary professionals who can provide unique perspectives to our work and share a vision of the library world from their perspectiveâto the conference. VRA + DLF Cross-Pollinator Travel Grant â coming soon! The purpose of this grant is to extend the opportunity to attend the DLF Forum to a visual resources professional who would not typically go to the Forum, but who can envision and articulate a connection with their work and who sees great value in building a dynamic and diverse peer network. Deadline Applications must be submitted before 4:00pm EDT on Friday, May 22, 2015. The fellowsÂ will be announced in July. Our Sponsors Thank you to our generous sponsors for making these fellowships possible.
