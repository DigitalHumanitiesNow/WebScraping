This morningÂ Andrew N. Jackson posted an interesting alternative to the smoothingÂ of sentiment trajectories. Â Instead of smoothing the trajectories with a moving average, lowess, or, dare I say it, low-pass filter, Andrew suggests cumulative summing as a “simpleÂ butÂ potentially powerful way of re-plotting” the sentiment data. Â I spent a little timeÂ exploring and thinking about his approach this morning, and I’m posting below a seriesÂ of “plot plots” from fiveÂ novels.[1] I’m not at all sure about how we could/should/wouldÂ go about interpreting these cumulative sum graphs, but the lack of information loss is certainly appealing. Â Looking at these graphs requires something of a mind shift away from the way that I/we have been thinking about emotional trajectories in narrative. Â Making that shift requires reframing plot movement as an aggregation of emotional valence over time, a reframing that seems to be modeling something like the “cumulative effect on the reader” as Andrew writes, or perhaps it’s the cumulative effect on the characters? Â Whatever the case, it’s a fascinating idea that while not fully in line with Vonnegut’s conception of plot shape does have some resonance with Vonnegut’s notion of relativity. Â The cumulative shapes seen below in Portrait and Gone GirlÂ are especially intriguing . . . to me.      [1]Â All of these plots use sentiment values extracted with the AFinn method, which is what Andrew implemented in Python. Â Andrew’sÂ iPython notebook, by the way, is worth a close read; it provides a lot ofÂ detail that is not in hisÂ blog post, includingÂ some deeperÂ thinking around the entire business of modeling narrative in this way.
