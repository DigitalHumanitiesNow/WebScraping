What constitutes the flesh of a work?  Does a word have flesh?  Does a book have flesh?  Does a film have flesh?  Does digital media have flesh? A book has weight, an odor, a certain texture in our hands.  It has pages that can be turned, torn, written upon, recycled, and burned.  The pages themselves are generally made from wood pulp, the processed innards (or flesh) of a tree.  And books are sometimes bound with leather, covers made of cured animal skins later dressed by book conservationists to keep them pliable.  The stuff used for leather dressing sounds almost like the list of ingredients for a facial moisturizer, a mixture of lanolin, cedar oil, and beeswax.
