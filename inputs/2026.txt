Text re-use detection is about uncovering quotations, paraphrases, allusions, or even analogies and translations. Since quoting never happens by chance but by a positive (agree with an earlier authorâ€™s text) or negative (disagree) purpose, we propose to use text re-use techniques for quantitative generation of text re-use graphs and identifying from them hotly quoted passages of a work that are used for scoring it by a "Cultural Heritage GooglePage" technique.
