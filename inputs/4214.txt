 Going to the ALA Annual Conference in Las Vegas this weekend? So are we! LibraryThing for Libraries will have a booth in the Technology Pavilion (thatâ€™s row 1200, booth #1247).  Stop by and say hi to Tim and KJ, and get a demo of our LTFL products, including some exciting new improvements to our recommendations feature. (Stay tuned for an official announcement.) Are you in the area and want a free pass just to the exhibit hall? We can help! Click here to get an exhibits-only pass.
