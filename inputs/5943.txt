After they took out the trache, they left an emergency trache kit in my room. Â I was happy not to need it, and I wonder if it was even the right size. Â On the last couple trache-free nights it sat there, ready. Â I was happy to walk out of the room, the floor (the staff said nice goodbyes and “please don’t come back”) and the hospital into the daylight. Â <a href=”http://superbon.net/?p=1087″ target=”_blank”>Well, sort of.</a> Â Even though the radiation was really unpleasant, I much preferred it as an outpatient experience. Â In terms of the actual experience, the 16.5 days in Montreal General–through no fault of theirs–was probably the longest single stretch of time in my life.
