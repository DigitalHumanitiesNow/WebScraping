This paper applies a state of the art quantitative method called Spectral Clustering in order to classify formal features of 162 archaeological stone masks. The algorithm was developed a decade ago by mathematicians working in the field of pattern recognition and has proven to be more effective than techniques such as component-linkage and k-means. We introduce it here to the Digital Classicist community, adapting the original method to fulfill the specific requirements of archaeological analysis. We also present a software package that implements the method. Our application of Spectral Clustering is only the first step in a more ambitious project focused on the automatic recognition and classification of shapes in two and three dimensions.
