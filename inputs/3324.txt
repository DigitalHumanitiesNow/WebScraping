Beginning later this week, I will be hosting a series of six salons on the Indiana University campus. The topic for discussion is scholarly publishing in the arts and humanities–at Indiana University and in general. In particular, our focus will be book publishing and our goal will be to work through the implications of a number of proposals for changing how we fund, publish, and access scholarly books in these fields. The salons are part of research that I am doing with IU and University of Michigan partners with support from a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Here are some links to help make sense of these events and their larger contexts. The Grant funding this work was one of two recently received by Mellon. The IU Bloomington Newsroom announced these here. An invitation to the upcoming salons, with the dates and details, is available here. A one page description of the study, along with links to more information on the topic is available here. I hope that my colleagues from across the IU campus will join the conversation at one of these events. The first will be held this Wednesday, March 25 from 10 to 11:30 A.M. in Hazelbaker Hall, Scholarsâ Commons, Wells Library.Filed under: open access, Publications, Scholarly Communication
