Glitch is a video exhibition that I co-curated with John Pomara. The show highlights the recent investigations of a group of artists who are investigating digital error. What are normally seen as network and interface malfunctions are exploited here in video, stills, and sound. Glitch explores the possibilities and spaces and moments that are exposed when things go wrong. The drama of digital trauma. Participating artists include Jon Cates, Paul B. Davis, Kyle Kondas,  LoVid, Shane Mecklenburger, Tom Moody, Vjanomolee, and Jenny Vogel. The gallery at Centraltrak is located at 800 Exposition Avenue in Deep Ellum, a historic neighborhood of downtown Dallas. View a Map to the Gallery space. Gallery Hours: Wed. - Sat., 12 - 5 p.m. | Sunday - closed | by appointment
