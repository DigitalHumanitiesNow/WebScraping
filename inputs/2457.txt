The best parts of the film are those addressing PTSD; although the resolution via Personal Mission Accomplished is a bit too much 'Murica ra-ra. Bradley Coopers' acting was phenomenal. Not my cup of ideology, but a better film than anticipated.If the film stays with me perhaps I'll flesh this out.Â
