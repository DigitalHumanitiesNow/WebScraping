Wow. I’m very grateful to have received the three advance endorsements below for The Emergence of the Digital Humanities, and from three such important scholar-practioners, Mark Sample, Jentery Sayers, and Matt Gold. These are posted at the publisher’s Website and at Amazon (under “reviews”) and they’ll appear on the back cover of the book, which is now due to be published August 27.    “Situated at the intersection of videogame studies, textual studies, and digital humanities research, The Emergence of the Digital Humanities is bold and exciting. Jones ties together disparate strands of digital culture in a coherent way, helping us to understand not only the present situation but also future technological change.”âMark Sample, George Mason University University.    “This engaging book brings us the humanities everted, rendered inside-out, attending critically to everyday life in a mixed reality. Digital and physical materials converge as Jones carefully unfolds the curious dimensions of games, maps, books, and other media. A must-have for anyone new to or already familiar with digital humanities.”âJentery Sayers, Department of English, University of Victoria    “An inspired, wide-ranging look at the current state of the digital humanitiesâessential reading for anyone interested in the past, present, and future of the field.”âMatthew K. Gold, City Tech and CUNY Graduate Center, Editor of Debates in the Digital Humanities
