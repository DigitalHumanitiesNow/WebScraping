Why declare a hiatus when you can just go on one? Â I’ve been thinking a lot about what to do with this space, but come to no conclusions. Â The archive is good, so I’d like to keep that up at least. In the meantime, there’s been some malware trouble. Â I’ve cleaned up my mess, and part of that is I’m a little concerned about the old theme I was using, so I’m going with the generic 2013 for now. Â Apologies for boring and obvious visual design.
