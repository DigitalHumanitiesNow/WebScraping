This project will investigate the creation of a sustainability indexÂ which will be the product of three variables: unique visitors, their return rate and the number of page requestsÂ per visit.  Unique visitors: this is related to a number of factors, such as the uniqueness of the content, the longevity of the site, how it is promoted, and access fees. Rate of repeat visits: a measure of how suited the site is to our visitors’ needs,Â aka loyalty Page views per Visit (‘stickiness’) Giving: Index of Sustainability = U Ã R Ã V Take the example of a cafe: it can increase its business by getting more people through the doors (U), increasing the amount its customers spend each time (V), and improving the frequency with which each customer comes back (R). In terms of resource allocation, the cafe has to decide which of these factors it could invest money in to bring it the biggest benefit; advertising to bring more people in (U), changing the product range or ambiance to increase money spent per visit (V), or the more diffuse aspects of loyalty (R) which could includeÂ more complicated activities such as taste tests. This project will mainly focus on improving user experience (V), andÂ refining the effectiveness ofÂ ISURV together with a set of orthogonal indicators which can be used to compare the functional performance of sub-site areas, a whole site, or even between separate sites. It willÂ amend discrete areas of content, leaving whole other areas untouched to allow contrast, and communicateÂ its results in a non-specialised language. Our first set of figures will be published in April 2012.
