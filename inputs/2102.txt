Live Stream  Slide ShowÂ      Text Mining the History of Medicine  from historyspot  Abstract:Â I will present the results of a collaborative and interdisciplinary project betweenÂ the National Centre for Text Mining (NaCTeM) and the Centre for the History of Science, Technology and Medicine (CHSTM) at the University of Manchester, demonstrating the capabilities of innovative text mining tools to allow the automatic extraction of information from two historical archives:Â theÂ British Medical JournalÂ (BMJ) (1840 â present) and the London-area Medical Officer of Health (MOH) reports (1848-1972). NaCTeM’s text mining tools have enriched these historical archives with semantic metadata automatically by extracting terms, named entities and events.Â  The development of a semantic search system focused on the understanding of historical changes in lung diseases since 1840. Seminars are normally streamed live online on this blog and on YouTube. To keep in touch, follow us on Twitter (@IHRDigHist) or at the hashtagÂ #dhist.
