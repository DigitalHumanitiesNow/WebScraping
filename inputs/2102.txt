2013 was a great year for music. So good, in fact, this much of it bled into 2014 and muddied the waters for many music critics. For example, there are arguments that no album in 2014 was better thanÂ BeyoncÃ©Â which was released in December of 2013–too late to make it onto most majors lists but too early to be on lists for 2014. For me, the albumÂ Death SpeaksÂ by David Lang featuring performances byÂ Shara Worden, Bryce Dessner, and Owen Pallett was released in 2013 but it colored all of my listening in 2014 because I didn’t discover this incredible piece of music until January of this year. Because of that, I paid perhaps too much attention to The National, My Brightest Diamond, and Owen Pallett. I promise, though, that it was worth it. All that having been said, 2014 was another solid year for good tunes. Below is a list of my favorite albums of the year and a few more than I couldn’t not mention. 10.
