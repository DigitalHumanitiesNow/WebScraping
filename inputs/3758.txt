The title says it all.  As my mom pointed out to me, American money now has some color variation in different denominations.  But looking down into my wallet, all I see is a sea of green.   Like those grass lawns that shouldn’t exist in Arizona.   Canadian money comes in different colors so that you instantly know what kind of bill you’re dealing with.  When I arrived in 2004 it felt like play money.  Now I realize what a brilliant decision color coding is, and apparently have a hard time living without it.  This does, however, raise questions.  Does monochrome American paper money “toughen up” its users somehow?  Does colorful Canadian money with hockey on it somehow make its users “softer”?  Less “rugged”?
