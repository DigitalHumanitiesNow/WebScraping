I had the first treatment today.  It was uneventful and painless.  It took a little longer than 15 minutes since they were getting used to me and adjusting my body on the bed.  The mask was nice and tight.  I was hoping there would be a laser or light sabre or something spectacular but I couldn’t even figure out which part of the machine was taking pictures and which part was shooting radiation into me.  The tech had to explain it to me after.  More tomorrow, since I’ve got an early-morning wakeup.
