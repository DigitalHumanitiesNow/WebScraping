Some books that I ordered from Amazon.com  Susan Strasser, Waste and Want: A Social History of Trash Jackson Lears, Fables of Abundance: A Cultural History of Advertising in America Lawrence Glickman, eds., Consumer Society in American History: A Reader Daniel Horowitz, The Morality of Spending: Attitudes Toward the Consumer Society in America, 1875-1940 Suellen Hoy, Chasing Dirt: The American Pursuit of Cleanliness Lots of good reading for the next few weeks. I'm including these books in my minor field survey on U.S. cultural history. I'm almost finished with a really good book by Michael Zakim, entitled Ready-Made Democracy: A History of Men's Dress in the American Republic, 1760-1860, which I plan to review in a post sometime this week.
