HESTIA (the Herodotus Encoded Space-Text-Imaging Archive)         is an interdisciplinary project that investigates the ways in which space is represented in Herodotus'         History, and that aims to capture the 'deep' topological structures of the text beyond the usual         two-dimensional Cartesian maps of antiquity.
