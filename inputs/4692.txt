Scholars’ Lab Speaker Series: Nick LaiaconaUsing Juxta Editions to Create Digital Scholarly EditionsWednesday, April 110:00 am Â· Alderman Library, Room 421 Juxta Editions is a professional editing suite for the creation of digital scholarly editions. Scholarly editors, historians, archivists, and academic librarians are routinely using the Internet to share primary source material with one another and the public. However, the set of technologies required to deliver a state-of-the-art scholarly edition remains difficult to master. Using Juxta, you can transcribe, annotate, collate, and publish to the Internet a work or collection of related writings. The session includes a demonstration of Juxta Editions. Nick Laiacona is the president of Performant Software Solutions LLC. Performant builds custom software and websites for digital humanities projects, including: Juxta, Collex, Typewright, BRANCH, TextLab, BigDIVA, Viral Texts, and Book Traces. Laiacona has acted as technical lead on digital projects funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and the National Institutes of Health.
