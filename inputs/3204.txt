A virtual presentation for HASTAC 2013: “Building an Academic Community for the Digital Age”The changing landscape of education in the digital age asks us to reconsider what, how, and where we learn. It asks us to rethink how we build scholarly networks and who we bring into those networks. The acts of teaching, learning, and research depend increasingly on collaboration. Collaboration, though, both in teaching and learning, is rarely institutionalized at an administrative level. It is still customary to have only one instructor of record assigned to each class. It is still customary for students to take tests by themselves. This practice obscures -- and discourages -- the collaborative work of colleagues, teaching assistants, and students. Likewise, the emphasis on scholarly monographs, particularly in the humanities, obscures the dynamic nature of the work we do as academics.
