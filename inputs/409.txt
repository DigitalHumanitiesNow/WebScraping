[First posted in AWOL 8 December 2013, updated 18 May 2015] Greek Manuscripts in Sweden Welcome to the project homepage of Greek Manuscripts in Sweden.  The aim of this project is to digitize and catalogue all the Greek  manuscripts in Sweden. Around 120 Greek manuscripts are kept in Swedish  libraries, but only a few of them have up to now been available in  digital form online. Libraries that contribute material to the database  include Gothenburg University Library (4 MSS), LinkÃ¶ping Diocesan  Library (29 MSS), Lund University Library (5 MSS), Nationalmuseum,  Stockholm (1 MS), The Royal Library, Stockholm (5 MSS), The Skokloster  Castle Library (3 MSS), and Uppsala University Library (74 MSS). The  project is run by two researchers, Dr. Eva NystrÃ¶m and Dr. Patrik  Granholm, in collaboration with photographers and computer specialists  at Uppsala University Library. The Central Bank of                     Sweden Tercentenary Foundation has contributed  financial support.             The Greek manuscripts, in the form of bound parchment and  paper volumes, include a rich and diverse collection of texts from  antiquity and the Byzantine period. They originate mainly from the  Byzantine cultural area from the tenth century onwards, but some are  Renaissance or early modern manuscripts from Western Europe. The  existing nineteenth-century catalogue is outdated and in many cases  incorrect. Furthermore it does not cover all manuscripts. It is  therefore essential to create a new catalogue according to modern  principles, including detailed codicological descriptions. Combined with  a comprehensive digitization of the manuscripts this will facilitate  and encourage new research on the material among Swedish and  international scholars. The catalogue will be fully searchable by the  encoding in TEI P5, which is an XML-based metadata standard for manuscript cataloguing.
