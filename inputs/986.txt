Are you someone who makes websites? If so, please consider visiting A List Apart and take their Web Design Survey for 2007. Very little is known about web design as a community and profession. Practically nothing is known about it historically, though its been around 10-15 years. This survey (and hopefully my dissertation on the history of CSS and web design) will help alleviate this oversights and start a much-needed dialog about web design, its practitioners, and its history.
