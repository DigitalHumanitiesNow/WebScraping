With the launch of volumes 13 to 17, the digitisation of the Survey of London monograph series as part of British History Online is now complete. The last batch of monographs covers buildings as diverse as the Queenâ€™s House at Greenwich, the College of Arms, and County Hall, the home of the Greater London Council before its abolition and now the backdrop to the London Eye.
