I’ve been meaning to post a link to a profile article that Adam Bluestein wrote on my digital humanities work in Fast Company. I’ve had a variety of experiences being interviewed, but this has been one of the most positive ones: I had a truly enjoyable extended chat with Adam and he managed to faithfully synthesize a lot of content into a relatively compact article. My only bone of contention is the title Big Data On Campus Is Like A Keg Stand For Your Brain, but presumably the editors are to blame for that, and not Adam  .
