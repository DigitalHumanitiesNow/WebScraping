 All videos are decoded for stereo playback. Please use headphones. This video demonstrates the mapping of skeletal data using an Xbox Kinect, Synapse, and Pure Data, within a developing live performance system. The kinect data controls in-kind spatial flocking behaviors of the ‘boids’ algorithm. Mapping Strategies for Embodied Metaphors – Improvised Musical Examples  This video demonstrates developmental spatial music mapping strategies, which exploit embodied music metaphors (see Johnson 2007).
