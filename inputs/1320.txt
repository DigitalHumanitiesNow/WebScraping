Lena Groeger (of ProPublica) has written a beautiful piece about the Power of Wee Things. She talks about using smallÂ things, multiples, and units to display data and get people interested. The article goes through many, many examplesÂ covering many different areas and ideas.Â She also gave a great talk on the topicÂ at OpenVis 2014.  On aÂ somewhat related note, Jake Harris wrote about the importance of individual items in data journalism and visualization, and how to connect with them. The two pieces work very well together to illustrate a way of visualizing data that isÂ often overlooked.
