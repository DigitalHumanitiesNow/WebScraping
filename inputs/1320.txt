Twentieth-Century Imagery  I don't speak French (I really don't speak English well, but that's a different story), but Pita from Rhone Alpes, France has three blogs that feature some fascinating images:  des chapeaux Agence eureka grenouille plus The vast majority of the posts feature images only, so you don't need to know French to appreciate them (the larger scans are really nice). But if anyone wants to translate specific posts and point them out to me I'd appreciate it!  The Vices and Virtues of the Department Store  Natalie Bennett at Philobiblon suspect that The Man to Ultimately Blame for Wal-Mart was William Whiteley, a 19th-century London department store owner. I sympathize, Natalie.  In contrast, Anthony Buccino at Uncle Tonoose takes a trip back to his childhood in Busy as Bamberger's on a Saturday Morning. The picture on Anthony's post is great.
