Or more accurately, I am losing my taste. Â I probably do have a flavour. This particular side effect of RAI can set in a few days after treatment, and in this case it did. I noticed it this morning at breakfast. Â It’s sort of like having a badly burned tongue–everything is muted, some flavours more than others. Last time this happened I couldn’t taste sour at all. Â This time I sort of can, but I’m trying to figure out what has taste and what doesn’t. Â At least I still have smellâ¦.
