James Halabuk is the first person to post a comment on my weblog. Because of this, James will receive $50,000 in cash and will now be the proud owner of a fully-loaded Lexus.  Disclaimer: James really isn't the winner of a new Lexus or $50,000, as mentioned above. I'm just happy to know that someone, other than my Mom, has looked at my site.  Don't worry: I'm working on more "serious" and "academic" posts to put on here in the future. Right now I'm just trying to get my reading and writing (and watching of documentaries) done for my classes. If you're bored, you can look at my post on scene analysis for Digital History Documentary. Paula has links to blogs written by other students in the class here.
