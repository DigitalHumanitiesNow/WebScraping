  On Wednesday May 20th, from 11:30am-1:30pm in SS 1339, the Faculty of Arts Teaching + Learning Committee will hostÂ a workshop on Your Teaching Dossier, presented byÂ Carol Berenson (Educational Development Unit) and Mike Adorjan (Sociology). Please note this is the second offering of this workshop. Material covered will be the same as in the fall session.  Click here to register in advance, if you would.    Student feedback formsÂ âÂ which many of us are circulating to students these daysÂ âÂ are valuable enough as a measure of teaching quality. But are they really enough? Are you satisfied letting them testify to your teaching quality, like the professor inÂ this classic Onion article? Learn how to assemble an effective teaching dossier to capture the habits and principles you put into your teaching. In related news, seeÂ this longer introduction and rationale for dossiers.    .      About the Teaching + Learning Workshops These are cross-disciplinaryÂ workshops that willÂ directly affect your course designs and delivery. Each oneÂ haveÂ an immediate andÂ concrete impactÂ on your teaching in everyÂ department and disciplineÂ in the Faculty of Arts. Registration is required.Â Most will have pre-workshop questions or even exercises for registrants to complete or consider before attending. Materials and resources will be available — normally here on this website — for those who want to follow up with them, and for those unable to attend. AÂ new feature for 2014-15 isÂ formal recognitionÂ of those whoÂ attendÂ three or more workshopsÂ in an academic year, or whoÂ present in any workshop. AÂ letter from theÂ Faculty of Arts will testify to your professional development inÂ merit, promotion and tenureÂ applications.
