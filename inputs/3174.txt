 Steven Jones argues in The Emergence of the Digital Humanities, that DH after 2008 is quite different from humanities computing due to a cultural phenomenon that William Gibson calls âthe eversion:â a term meaning âturning inside out.â For Jones and Gibson, the development of mobile media platforms, the rise of social media applications, and the spread of maker culture question the once stable separation between everyday life and what was once called âcyberspace.â This course will examine how the eversion impacts the examination of materiality, with particular emphasis to textual or literary studies. Materiality has many definitions, both within the digital humanities and in other fields. We will explore versions of new materialism in twentieth-century philosophy before questioning what materiality means in typography, the materiality of seemingly immaterial digital archives, the geological materials that make up our most common electronic devices, the forensic âgutsâ of our computational systems, the impact of mobile media on our sense of material embodiment, and the rise of digitally-mediated forms of material extrusion and manipulation in physical computing. Requirements include two presentations and a final paper, but students will also be given the opportunity to replace the paper for a final digital project or artifact using the Makey-Makey or Arduino platforms. Course Objectives. After taking this course, students will be able to Compare approaches to understanding materiality in traditional textual and bibliographical scholarship with those found in the digital humanities and physical computing. Examine tools becoming common among digital humanists to explore materiality including the Arduino, the Makey-Makey, and 3D-Printers. Explore the impact of digitized modes of manufacturing on issues like electronic waste, repurposing, and the labor practices of programmers. Question how physical computing and digital archiving might question but also extend traditional forms of scholarly communication. Explore how digital humanists appropriate theoretical concepts from new materialism and object-oriented ontology to complicate traditional approaches to manufacturing objects and commercial products.
