Throughout history, artefacts have been removed from their original location by a series of processes, leaving a fragmented picture of the material past. Geospatial and visualization technologies give us the opportunity to visualize and conceptualize the histories of such dispersed heritage, recording findspot, current location and physical and interpretive stages that went between. Using examples including Romano-British verse inscriptions and geographic data gathered on Hadrianâ€™s Wall, we will show a database of different types of cultural heritage objects with multiple location fields. Using a combination of quantitative GIS and KML-based views of the data, we will illustrate how the history of artefacts can be traced through both time and location.
