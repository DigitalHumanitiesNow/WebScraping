[Update 1/27: Link to the unabridged Tempspence tweets] From Jan 1- Jan 26th, @spencerprattâs Twitter account written by an unknown British poet who had found Spencerâs phone. Turns out he was the main character in a new netprov that Rob and I collaborated on.  Through the fictional tale of this obscure poet broadcasting from a Reality starâs account, we explored themes of fame, language play, and what it means to be real. The storyline: The story began when Spencer lost his mobile phone while in London. On January 1, Heidi tweeted: Another wild NYE! So wild Spencer canât find the new phone I got him for Christmas. Itâs probably in the hotel, but since weâve been here, weâve seen:  Big Ben, London Bridge, Buckingham Palace, went ice skating, and played in red phone booths and taxis.  So basically he couldâve lost it anywhere in the UK. @spencerprattâs next tweets were: Testing…Testing…. OMG! Woh. Yes, cheers, everyone, this is actually Spencer Pratt. And I am married to Heidi Montag. Wow. Spencer sounded different. He knew an awful lot about poetry all of the sudden, including asking followers for bookshop recommendations in London and correcting Twitter followers on their knowledge of haikus.  When he went into CBB, however, he kept tweeting. How was this possible? At first he claimed he had found his phone and had been allowed as a plot twist on the new season of CBB, but when CBB producers denied that claim, it became apparent someone had his phone and wanted to sell it. Over the next few days, the phone thief or lucky bloke released a series of âintimateâ photos of Heidi showing off her gorgeous mani-pedi, flirting with Gandalf, and showing off her enormous stack of laundry.  When the phone finder couldnât sell the mobile in England, he exposed himself as an obscure British poet who was dying to promote his literary career but could never do that out of fear of being arrested.  Tempspence, as he was dubbed, began playing poetry games with Spencerâs followers and fending off accusations that he was a thief.  Tempspence took his Spencer name seriously, telling the story of his own romantic life with Una and Duessa, characters in Rennaisance-poet Edmund Spenserâs Faerie Queene.  Following the Big Brother format, followers voted which woman he would try to pursue by ReTweeting.
