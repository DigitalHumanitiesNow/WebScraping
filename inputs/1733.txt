 So, remember that time I went to Kuwait? And remember how on that tripâprobably one of the most insightful, intellectually-stimulating, and eye-opening travel experiences Iâve ever hadâI met the team of scrappy artists, architect, thinkers, and writers behind the Kuwaiti pavilion for the 2014 Venice Biennale, who shared their amazing vision for what the cultural heritage in their country could and should be? And how, when I came home, I compulsively purchased tickets to Venice, because I just had to see their research and advocacy realized in the form of an exhibition?Â  Well, I wrote about their story. You can find it on selected newsstands in the November/December issue of Art Papers magazine or online here.Â
