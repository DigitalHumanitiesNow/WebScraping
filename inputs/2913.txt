26 September 2014 Today, I attended the dh conference, Network Detroit, and presented on the Public Philosophy Journal (http://publicphilosophyjournal.org/), in a talk entitled, âReimagining Scholarly Publishing and the Public Philosophy Journal.â  It is a wonderful regional conference that attracts many DHers from the midwest and beyond.  The conference is in its second year, held at Lawrence Tech, and wonderfully run by Melinda Weinstein  (@Melindawp) and Nathan Kelber  (@nkelber). The talk was put together from a talk by our Penn State partners,  Christopher Long (@cplong) and  Mark Fisher (@mdfphilpsu) and was well received.
