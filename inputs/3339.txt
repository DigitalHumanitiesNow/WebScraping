 The following videos demonstrate another set of developmental mapping strategies for spatial music performance, which exploit bodily-based metaphors (see Johnson 2007). This set of examples present moving sound objects (individuated audio for each guitar string) moving from the front of the performance space to the rear. As each object is passed to an audio effects channel (applying delay & filtering processes) as they approach the central point of the array in an attempt to reify the notion of time passing by the listener. Objects that maintain a certain amplitude as they reach the rear of the array will cease to move, assuming a fixed spatial location behind the listener, becoming an object of prior experience. New note events will always enter at the front of the loudspeaker array.  the future is in front of me | the past is behind me
