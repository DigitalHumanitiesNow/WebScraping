Thursday, April 12, 2012, 4:30-6 pm370 Dwinelle HallUniversity of California, Berkeley An ongoing speaker and workshop series with events once per semester, Computing and the Practice of History explores the possibilities and challenges that come with the use of digital technology in historical and other humanities and social science research.  Our speakers will discuss how they use computing technology in their own research, and they are also invited to address larger questions regarding the future of computing in the humanities and social sciences.  They are selected to represent a variety of fields and a variety of technologies, so that our series might offer the broadest possible introduction to the ways that historians are using computing technology today. For the spring iteration of Computing and the Practice of History, our guest is Peter K. Bol, the Carswell Professor of East Asian Languages and Civilizations and the Director of the Center for Geographic Analysis at Harvard University, and our topic is historical geo-spatial information systems (GIS). Professor Bol is the chair of the China Historical GIS project, and also the China Biographical Database Project, a joint project of Harvard University, Academia Sinica, and Peking University, the goal of which is “to include all significant biographical material from Chinaâs historical record and to make the contents available free of charge, without restriction, for academic use.” This lecture is free and open to the public, sponsored by the Department of History at the University of California, Berkeley, with support from the Mellon Foundation.
