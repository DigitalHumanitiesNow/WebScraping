Abandoned Places asks "why are abandoned places so attractive?" The site uses frames (very annoying), but it contains fantastic images of abandoned factories, barracks, airplanes, and whole towns in various places in Europe. You may already know, from how often I link to them, that I love individual, enthusiastic projects like this. (Hat Tip: D. Keith Robinson.)
