1 Introduction1.1 Aim, scope and focus of the studyAim1.1.1 The overarching aim of the report is to explore and suggest practical directions and actions to move toward more cost-effective creation, dissemination and exploitation of citation data in the context of current and potential future usage scenarios. A further aim is to propose the roles that Jisc and others might play in this system in future.Scope and focus1.1.2 The general scope of this work is the creation and exploitation of citation data derived from peerreviewed academic research articles. However, the citation of datasets is specifically excluded. While  bibliographic metadata associated with the referencing and referenced outputs is clearly relevant, it is  not the focus of the work. Approaches to exploitation of citation data are also not the focus of the review, except in as much that this might increase or change the demand for different types of citation data.1.2 Study approach1.2.1 The study approach has been informed by the JISC invitation to tender (JISC Executive, 2012) and was conducted in three phases. In the first phase, desk research and an intensive series of interviews were undertaken with key stakeholders including publishers, citation data providers, citation data users, research funders to understand the strategic drivers. The information gathered was used to identify possible outline usage scenarios and develop a business model framework together with an initial view of the pros and cons of each scenario.1.2.2 In the second phase, an agreed set of usage scenarios and business models were developed and refined in consultation with users of citation data, publishers and citation data providers. In addition, a DevCSI developersâ workshop or Hack Day was held on 27 September 2012 [6] to explore usage of citation data through short trials or pilots using real citation data. This brought together a group of domain experts, users and developers to explore ideas related to potential real world uses of citation data and to prototype potential solutions. The group investigated aspects of citation data and its use, including the properties of sparse networks of data, and considering new ways to visualise citation data. The event provided some interesting perspectives on the use of citation data, and in particular supported the design of the âopenâ processes.1.2.3 In the final phase, the results of the second phase have been used to develop options for a viable practical direction and set of actions for taking the use of citation data forward. It is planned to seek  feedback and agreement with stakeholders at a final stakeholder meeting.Source and Full Text Available At:[http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/5371/1/Access-to-Citation-data-report-final.pdf]
