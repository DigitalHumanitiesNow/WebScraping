This paper will argue that Ptolemy’s Geographike Hyphegesis does not represent a linear development of Greek geographic thought but is instead a unique fusion of pre-Ptolemaic sources that far surpasses its precursors. It makes the case that the work’s purpose is to provide a terrestrial counterpart to the astronomical data and compiled in the Almagest. This is expressly to derive local celestial phenomena for a given time in order to draw a wide range of astrological, meteorological, environmental and anthropological conclusions.
