I'm hoping to have something a little more in depth about Soviet dissertations and/or quantifying the topics of plagiarized papers in Russia. In the meantime, I have a bit of data from the conferences of the Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies (ASEEES, the former AAASS), the main scholarly association for Russian and Eurasian studies.What I did for this was parse the records of the national ASEEES/AAASS conventions from 2004 to 2012 and count the words that appear, not counting very common words (stopwords). I don't think the results will shock anyone but they are interesting to see. Russian, Soviet and Russia are by far the three most common words, which reflects the dominance of Russian studies in ASEEES. However, I was a little surprised that Poland and Polish were the 14th and 21st most common. Last observation and then I will post the hundred most common words in the data: Stalin > Dostoevsky > Tolstoy > Pushkin > Putin.
