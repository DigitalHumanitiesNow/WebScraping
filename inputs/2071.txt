The Digital Humanities Winter Institute (previous post)Day OneWe began with introductions.  Over half the class are graduate students.  Some librarians in the mix.Our instructors are Wayne Graham and Jeremy Boggs of  the Scholar's Lab at the University of Virginia.We began learning basic commands at the terminal prompt using Mac computers: cd for change directory, mkdir for make a directory, etc. This took me back to the early 1990's when I was learning how to use DOS.We moved on to basic HTML and spent most of the time with CSS.  We learned how to put together elementary scripts and Jeremy and Wayne showed us some shortcuts, what to use and more importantly, what functions to avoid.Keynote lecture by Sebastian Chan, Director of Digital & Emerging Media at the  Smithsonian, Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum in New York City.  Dr. Chan talked about rethinking  museum collections from passive experiences to interactive, mobile opportunities.  He used the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney, Australia as an example.
