This seminar will explore the implications and significances of layout and visual         presentation on the text of Servius's Commentaries. It will examine the state of the text and the variety         of ways this has been presented over the centuries, and demonstrate how digital technology can be used         to create a different way of reading the Commentaries, which reflects earlier reading habits as well as new         ones arising from digital media.
