All 32 volumes of the Calendar of Treasury Books are now available on British History Online. These volumes show in great detail the income, expenditure and debts of the government between the Restoration in 1660 and 1718, including information on, for example, pensions paid to Army and Navy widows. The papers are of various kinds but can be roughly divided into minute books, which summarise meetings, and warrant books â€“ which include all other items; additionally the editors provide extensive account summaries in their introductions. This series complements two similar ones: the Calendar of Treasury Papers, which calendars the Treasury Board Papers, and the Calendar of Treasury Books and Papers. The latter is a continuation of the other two series but now calendared together.
