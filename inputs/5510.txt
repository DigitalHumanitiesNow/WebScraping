Now that the group stage is over, it's time for an update of our World Cup network!Nodes and labels are sized according to their outdegree (yay Belgium!).Â Draws generate no ties, so that's why the number of edges in each cluster differs. The top left group is the only one with no draws.Edge weight is again based on the difference in goals (let's ignore Belgium here...).Now that the round of 16 has started, connected components should start to emerge soon, resulting in a giant one in the end. We'll keep you posted!
