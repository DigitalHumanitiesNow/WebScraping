"Google Anniversary", "how to hack a website" and "hack website". While the "google anniversary" search lists my post on Dan's 9/11 Anniversary Google map (first, by the way), the last two list my post on the HACK website I created (that's Society for History and Computer Knowledge). The people trying to figure out how to hack a website must surely be disappointed when they read my post. I just hope they don't hack my website.
