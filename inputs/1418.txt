 At the beginning of June, guitar player, lover of music (both country and western), Ruby developer and former resident of Reston VA, Brooks Robertson joined the Esri DC Development Team. We are really excited to have him on the team. In addition to a flair for travel, he brings 15 years of development experience, including 8 years of working with Ruby on Rails. In recent years heâs been focusing on application optimization and integration with Lucene, Redis, Couchbase and other technologies. Brooks will be focusing making the backend/API of ArcGIS for Open Data even more amazing. He will be working in our DC office, and we look forward to his pull requests. Fun Fact: I was raised by wolves that taught me tragedy plus time equals sandwich. -- Brooks
