LaQuAT investigates technologies for providing integrated views across heterogeneous ancient documentary         text collections, including relational databases with different schemas and an XML corpus. These structurally diverse datasets overlap         geographically, chronologically, and prosopographically, and so a mechanism for querying an integrated set of them is of considerable         potential value to the researcher.
