Eusebius of Caesarea: Tradition and Innovations, by Aaron Johnson and Jeremy Schott, eds.The Center for Hellenic Studies is pleased to announce the online publication of Eusebius of Caesarea: Tradition and Innovations, by Aaron Johnson and Jeremy Schott, eds. on the CHS website. The work is available for purchase in print via Harvard University Press. Eusebius of Caesarea was one of the most significant and voluminous  contributors to the development of late antique literary culture.  Despite his significance, Eusebius has tended to receive attention more  as a source for histories of early Christianity and the Constantinian  empire than as a writer and thinker in his own right. He was a compiler  and copyist of pagan and Christian texts, collator of a massive  chronographical work, commentator on scriptural texts, author of  apologetic, historical, educational, and biographical works, and  custodian of one of the greatest libraries in the ancient world. As  such, Eusebius merits a primary place in our appreciation of the  literary culture of late antiquity for both his self-conscious  conveyance of multiple traditions and his fostering of innovative  literary and intellectual trajectories. By focusing on the full range of  Eusebiusâs literary corpus, the collection of essays in Eusebius of Caesarea offers  new and innovative studies that will change the ways classicists,  theologians, and ancient historians think about this major figure.Aaron Johnson is Assistant Professor of Humanities and Classics at Lee University.Jeremy Schott is Associate Professor of Religious Studies at Indiana University Bloomington.1.
