The Public Humanities Group affiliated with the Consortium of Humanities Centers andÂ  Institutes (CHCI) seeks respondents from higher-education institutions for an online survey gauging contemporary perspectives about the âpublic humanities.âÂ  TheÂ  questionnaire (designed to take between 10 and 15 minutes) inquires into how important the public humanities are at various institutions; what kinds of activities faculty members think contribute to the public humanities; the percentage of time that educators spend on such activities; and the impact educators believe various public humanities activities and media outlets have.Â  Free-form fields in the survey also allow respondents to volunteer additional issues and perspectives. The responses will inform a workshop on the public humanities at the Jackman Humanities Institute at the University of Toronto during the summer of 2015. Any volunteered information revealing the identity of a respondentÂ  will not be shared without consent.Â  (The survey was created for the CHCI Public Humanities Group by the Office of Digital Humanities at Brigham Young University.)
