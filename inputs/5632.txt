For the past year or so, Iâve been kicking around the idea of getting folks involved in digital humanities for undergraduates together to talk about what we do differently, what we do that is the same, and how to build a set of best practices that will be useful to other undergrad #dh programs that are getting started.Â  I was excited to see some workshops of a similar theme at this yearâs DHSI (#3 -Models for DH at Liberal Arts Colleges and #15 Digital Pedagogy Integration in the Curriculum) and thrilled to have a workshop thatâs all about hashing out the issues that practitioners of #dh for undergrads face at DH2015 in Sydney this summer. Weâre looking for participants from across the disciplines and professions.Â  We also welcome students who want to weigh in on what a digital curriculum might mean for them.Â  Weâre also hoping to internationalize this conversation and bring together #dh practitioners from different countries and different educational systems.Â  The full CFP is below, but we encourage anyone who is interested to reach out to us at startingfromscratchDH (at) gmail (dot) com.
