Back in June, the folks at IMLS and Heritage Preservation ran a webinar exploring the issues and tools discussed at the IMLS Webwise Crowdsourcing panel "Sharing Public History Work: Crowdsourcing Data and Sources." After a introduction by Kevin Cherry and Kristen Laise,  Sharon Leon, who chaired the live panel, presented a wonderful overview of crowdsourcing cultural heritage and discussed the kinds of crowdsourcing projects that have been successful -- including, of course, the Papers of the War Department and Scripto, the transcription tool the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media developed from that project.  They then ran the video of my own presentation, "Lessons from Small Crowdsourcing Projects", followed by a live demo of FromThePage.  Perhaps the best part of the webinar, however, was the Q&A from people all over the country asking for details about how these kinds of projects work.The recording of the webinar is online, and I encourage you to check it out.  (Here's a direct link, if you have trouble.) I'm very grateful to IMLS and Heritage Preservation for their work in making this knowledge accessible so effectively.
