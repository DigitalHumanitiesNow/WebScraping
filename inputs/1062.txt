 Â The Black History Month reads were just the preview….. Left of Black host and Duke University Professor Mark Anthony Neal (@NewBlackMan) is joined in studio by Professor Jessica Marie Johnson (@jmjafrx) and Professor Treva Blaine Lindsey (@DivaFeminist), co-authors of the essay “Searching for Climax: Black Erotic Lives in Slavery and Freedom.” In the essay Professor Johnson (Michigan State University) and Professor Lindsey (The Ohio State University) grapple with the âerotic lives of black women during slavery,â offering a ânew lens with which to comprehend the lived experience of chattel slavery.â The essay was published as part of a special issue of Meridians: feminism, race, transnationalism. I posted on the essay here. This historic special issue celebrates “Harriet Tubman: A Legacy of Resistance.” Many thanks, as always, to the brilliant guest editor Janell Hobson!
