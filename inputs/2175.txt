Henry David Thoreau, in his journal on 24th December 1841: I want to go soon and live away by the pond, where I shall hear only the wind whispering among the reeds. It will be success if I shall have left myself behind. But my friends ask what I will do when I get there. Will it not be employment enough to watch the progress of the seasons?  (Thanks to Peter for this quote.)
