This past weekend I gave a talk at EmpireJS on the Computer Science platform that I’ve been developing at Khan Academy. The talk explores that platform and then goes into deeper technical details about how the real-time execution on the site was achieved. I recorded the talk on my laptop (so please excuse the echo as it wasn’t properly mic’ed up) and you can watch it here:  A slightly older (stats are slightly out of date) version of the slides can be found here:
