The Camino de Santiago (the Way of Saint James) is a pilgrimage in Southern Europe that begins in a number of European countries like France, Spain, Germany, England and Portugal and ends in Santiago de Compostella in Spain. There are many different routes that pilgrims can take to walk the Camino and some of these routes are over a thousand kilometres long and may take many weeks to walk.  It’s one of the oldest and most important pilgrimages in Christianity, dating to about 813 AD, and it meanders through some of the most cultutally rich parts of Southern Europe. Apart from all the churches, there are lots of pastries and cakes,  expresso, beer and wine along the way (and the PortuguÃ©s have a beer called Superbock that I have a spiritual relationship with that is growing day by day) I had just two weeks to do the Camino, so decided on the Camino PortuguÃ©s from Porto in Portugal to Santiago de Compostella in Spain (a distance of about 240 KMS over 14 days).  Anyone can do the Camino for whatever reason, you don’t have to be Christian, you can be a tourist, a health conscious person, or just curious like me (but do remember, this is a Christian pilgrimage). And if you are wondering what a pilgrimage is, I found this great definition in a book of maps of Camino PortuguÃ©s  by John Brierley. All of us travel two paths simultaneously; the outer path along which we haul our body and the inner pathway of soul. We need to be mindful of both and take time to prepare ourselves accordingly. The traditional way of the pilgrim is to travel alone, by foot, carrying all the material possessions we might need for the journey ahead. This provides the first lesson form the pilgrim – to leave behind all that is superfluous and to travel with only the barest necessities. Preparation for the inner path is similar – we start by letting go of psychic waste accumulated over the years such as resentments, prejudices, and outmoded belief systems. With an open mind and open heart we will more readily assimilate the lessons to be found along the ancient Path of Enquiry.  Day one: PortoThe main train station in Porto   I started the Camino PortuguÃ©s in Porto, which is the most popular place to start this particular  route, but some pilgrims also start in Lisbon (but I am told that there is a lot of walking on roads from Lisbon to Porto).  Porto is one of my favourite cities in Europe, built in a river valley with a old town centre of cobblestone alleyways and beautiful mosaic-decorated houses and public buildings, including the main train station (and I have a long, black Porto cape, similar to what the students wear, that I don on special occasions). The first day of the Camino from Porto is pretty dull as it takes almost the entire day to get out of the city through the endless suburbs. It is best to get the Metro to Vilarinho and start the walking from there (but I didn’t know this at the time and I wish that I had have spent one more night in Porto at the Tattva Hostel instead as it is one of the best hostel I have ever stayed at. Hostels have come a very long way and Portugal has some of the best ones).  Day two: Mosterio de Vairao  After the endless walk out of Porto, and feeling a bit grim, I came across this big spooky monestery where I spent the first night. Pilgrims stay in places like this that are called Albegues and they are very affordable at only 5-6 Euros a night. There was only one other person staying at the monestery, an older Spanish man who spoke no English (and I have no Spanish nor PortuguÃ©s language skills). And almost no one speaks English in this part of the world, so I reluctantly prepared for the inner journey of the Camino! Day three: BarcelosFollowing the little yellow arrows...  Barcelos The Camino got alot more interesting after Mosterio de Vairao as the path wasn’t all ashfelt, suburban streets. The Camino trail is clearly marked with cool little yellow arrows that are painted on rocks, fences, houses, signs, and almost any inanimate object. In Spain yellow shells are used as well; the symbol of the Camino. Day four: Lugar de Corgo  (Casa de Fernanda) Roman roads  The Camino today followed some original Roman roads that wound through many old school villages and wineries (and notably, the population is likewise, pretty old in this part of the world). I stayed in a private Alberque for the night which was basically a home stay run by a friendly lady called Fernanda who cooked fish and potatoes for dinner and provided some great PortuguÃ©s port and conversion. This was excellent for my “inner Camino” because I hadn’t talked to anyone in four days, only pointed at pastries and bottles of Superbock in cafÃ©s. Day five: Ponte de Lima    This is an idealic Portuguese town, built aroud a town square and a stone bridge. I got into Ponte de Lima in the early afternoon so had plenty of time for cakes and beer. All the town squares in Portugal have free Wi Fi so it is possible to check the dating apps to see what all the Christians are up too. Day six: Pedreira  I stayed in a wonderful private Alberque this night called Quinta Estrada Romano, which was new and only had one other guest. In the private Alberque ‘s, dinner and breakfast is usually supplied and they are much better than the Association Alberque ‘s which tend to be a bit stern (and have 10PM curfews and no Superbock). Still, the Camino is all about walking and this day I walked 33 KMS. The physical walking isn’t that difficult, but geeze, I am doing some hard, lonely soul work). Day seven: Valenca (Portugal) Tui (Spain)Tui, the first town in Spain  Valenca old town Today I only walked about 10 KMS because I stumbled across two of the most beautiful towns so far on the journey, Valanca in Portugal and Tui in Spain (that are close to each other, separated by a river and a national border). Valenca’s old town is within a fabulous fort, entered through long tunells in the fort’s wall.  And Tui is built on a hill around a cathedral and square. Tui was having a festival this day, so I sat in the town square and drank some Superbock, watched a paramilitary/religious parade, and saw a lot of Spanish dancing (the Spanish seem as though they want to break out and dance at any moment).  I ate a hamburger because it was the only thing on the menu I could recognise and it turned out to be a foot in diameter. I will be the only person in the entire history of the Camino to put on weight! Day eight: MosThe path to Mos   Today I woke at 5 AM because for what ever reason, the psychopathic Alberque in Tui turns the lights on at this ungodly time.  Thus, I didn’t get a lot of sleep, but at 5 Euros a night, who am I to complain.  I stared to walk at 8 AM and forgot to go to a cafe for breakfast and couldn’t find one for a grumpy two hours. I had croissants and expresso, then continued on my journey. Spain is a lot different to Portugal, there are a lot more people and it has industrialised in an uglier way (I suppose we call this richer in the Modern world). At least this is the bit I saw today as there were a lot of industrial and commercial estates to walk through. After walking a respectable 20 KMS, I arrived at the Alberque in Mos at 2 PM and thankfully, there were no other annoying pilgrims there, which was good as it gave me the space to read and write, some of the best aspects of traveling (and I am just beginning to like my own company).  Day Nine: Arcade  Today I walked for about 25 KMS, which is not as far as it seems, or at least it is not as far as I thought it was going to be at the beginning of the journey. You get used to walking this distance pretty quickly and I usually finish my days walking by 1 or 2 PM. But this depends on how many cafÃ©s and bars I stop at along the way and what time I have lunch (which is usually 2 or 3 in this part of Spain). A tip for the Camino is remember to not start drinking too early. The Alberque at Redondela  I stayed at a fabulous private Alberque called Lar De Pepa, with the first bunch of pilgrims that I actually liked! The Alberques remind me of backpacking in the 1990s, lots of traveler comeraderie and authentic travelers (or in  this case pilgrims). A bunch of us went to a local bar and watched a Champions League football match in the evening. Day Ten: Pontevedra  Follow the shell! The symbol of the Camino It rained today, so I didn’t walk that far. I walked to Pontevedra which was only 12 KMS away.  The track wove through some pretty cool forests, full of lots of eucalyptus trees, not sure how they got here, some Australian pilgrims long ago perhaps. Plus there were few hills, but the hills are never more than a few hundred meters high, so they are very easy to traverse. The bridge at Arcade  Day Eleven: Alberque Briallos/ Portas  Today was a pretty uneventful day because it rained! So I didn’t end up walking very far (but it was kind of fun walking in the rain). I ended up in a lage, deserted, municipal Alberque and rang a number on the front door and the caretaker told me where to find the key to open it up. So I had the whole place to myself which was pretty good after spending the previous night in  a 60+ pilgrim dorm (walking through Pontevedra first thing in the morning was the best thing with all its cafes, always the cafÃ©s!) The bridge at Pontevedra. Note the Camino shells on the bridge Pontevedra, town square Day Twelve: Caldas de Reis  Today it rained for most of the day (again), so I only walked about 10 KMS to the next town, Caldas de Reis. And what a beautiful town that is was, with lots of cafÃ©s,  a couple of free municipal hot baths, a botanical garden, and endless expresso. The Alberque was comfortable,  and next to a stone bridge and bubbling creek (and again, at a bargain-pilgrim price at only 6 Euros a night). It is fantastic that a sophisticated network of Alberques exist all over southern Europe so pilgrims can walk all the way to Santiago. And I am only about 40 KMS away now, and could possibly walk this in one day, but I am ahead of schedule and am enjoying the slow pace (and for the record the Camino PortuguÃ©s is physically easy and anyone with a reasonable level of fitness could do it, possibly in a few days, but then again, it isn’t an physical endurance test, it’s a soul test!). Bridge next to the Alberque in Caldas de Reis Fountain in Caldas de Reis  Day Thirteen: Pedron Today I woke early after not getting much sleep in the Alberque because it was full of snoring, geriatric, pilgrims. And remember if you do the Camino, you don’t have to stay at the Alberques, there are plenty of other options, but hey, I’m on a budget! And the morning walk was spectacular. It was Sunday morning, there was a heavy mist, and I walked through forests and ancient wine groves with the sound of church bells on the distance. I walked the 20 kms to Pedron where the Sunday market was happening. I had lunch in a packed and freneric tent (squid, bread and potatoes with two bottles of Superbock). I also had coffee that the waiter topped up with what looked like rum. I asked the ladies next to me what it was and they said “turpentine” and we all laughed. The waiter continued to fill it with turpentine and then Baileys Rum so I was a bit drunk when I checked into my Alberque (before the 10 PM curfew).     Day Fourteen: Santiago de Compostella! The last 20 KMS of the pilgrimage were easy. I feel like I could walk another few hundred kilometers and I will do the 800 KMS French Camino one day and hats-off to all the people who have done that one. Admittedly it has been hard doing the Camino alone, but I wouldn’t have it any other way. Physically I found the 240 KMS of walking fairly easy, it was the battle with the self that was the hard bit. Sometimes I felt my soul screaming out in pain, of the lonliest highways I have ever seen, of days without taking to anyone in English, of huge dorm rooms packed with Christian pilgrims, of heavy rain and then bright, sweaty hot days, of lonely villages with a few sheep and goats for company (no, not what you think), and of deserted Alberques where I was the only ghostly pilgrim.  Does the Camino change you? I’m not sure, time will tell, but it is certainly one of the strangest paths I have ever walked. It is a deep path, of over a thousand years, and all sorts of memories and emotions came to the surface whilst I walked it, some pleasant, some not so pleasant. But I feel pretty good about doing it and would recommend it to anyone who wants to think about life for a while whilst doing something physically healthy and culturally significant.  Now I am prepared for South America, for a much longer journey, to another Santiago, 8 months away.
