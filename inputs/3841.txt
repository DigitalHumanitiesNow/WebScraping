I’ve written a bit about our adventures with the low-iodine diet, or as carnivorous Carrie calls it, “worse than vegan.”  This post is for search engines and the vegetarian thyroid cancer patients who may use them in anticipation of radioactive iodine treatment, but of course you’re welcome to read on if you don’t fall in either category.  I also detail how I rigged up internet in my hospital room to keep me occupied and in touch with the outside world for 48 hours. It’s a long document, so I’ve made it a .pdf, available here.
