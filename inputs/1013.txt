The StoryCorps Griot is a one-year funded project that plans to record stories from 1750 African-American families across the United States, focusing especially on veterans of the Second World War and participants in the Civil Rights movement. Starting February 15, StoryCorps will visit Atlanta, Georgia to conduct interviews. Griot (pronounced "gree-oh") "is a role of honor, designating someone who maintains community tradition and memory through storytelling, music, and dance."
