These are ten simple ideas that will go a long way in making youÂ a moreÂ organized and productive student (and impress your professors and employers).  Bring paper and a pen to every meeting.Â  This is a pet peeve of many, many faculty and employers. Take notes while in meetings.Â  You will not remember everything later. Do not use social media in a meeting.Â  Put away your iPhone and focus on the person or people with whom you are speaking. Dialogue, donât monologue.Â  When engaging in casual conversation, always be sure to ask about other peopleâs interests and avoid the trap of talking too much about yourself.Â  Remember, you can learn a lot from others. Whenever possible, schedule meetingsÂ at least a week ahead and use your institutionâs shared, online calendar system. Keep meetings productive by having a specific set of items or problems that you would like to discuss. Never leave a meeting without a clear understanding of ânext stepsâ.Â  Make sure to have a clear timeline for the completion of a project. If you do not understand something, ask immediately for clarification. Respectfully listen to other peopleâs ideas.Â  Even if you disagree, you might learn something.Â  If you like another personâs idea, be sure to let them know. BRING A PAPER AND PEN TO EVERY MEETING!!!    If you have some more suggestions, please add them in the Comments section.
