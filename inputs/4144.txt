Starting tomorrow I get to teach, for the first time, a graduate seminar on Media Archaeology alongside what I call âmedia poetics,â or the writerly practice of exploring the limits and possibilities of given reading/writing technologies. While we will do conventional reading writing in a seminar setting, our class will also do hands-on experiments in theÂ Media Archaeology LabÂ with its collection of zombie media and early digital art/literature so that we use the MAL to test hypotheses gleaned from the weekly reading. Following Friedrich Zielinski work on variantology, our class will move from the present through the past, uncovering a series of media phenomena, hopefully as a way to avoid reinstating a model of media history that tends toward narratives of progress and generally ignores neglected, failed, or dead media. We will also do this by reading works of media poetics at the same time. For example, we will read work by Marshall McLuhan on the capabilities of the typewriter alongside typewritten concrete poetry; we will read early works of digital literature from the 1980s alongside writing by Friedrich Kittler on discourse networks; we will read Zielinski on variantology alongside digital literature/art iPad/iPhone apps that work against the standardizing effects of the Apple developer guidelines; and we will read recent work by Jonathan Crary on our culture of 24/7 connectedness to networks of control alongside work by glitch and net artists to assess the degree to which we can resist these networks of control. Please take a look at the syllabus – suggestions for improvement/comments welcome.Filed under: media archaeology lab, media poetics Tagged: history of computing, media archaeology, media poetics, pedagogy, syllabus, teaching
