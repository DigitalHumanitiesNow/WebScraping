So IÂ almostÂ landed an interview with Kirk Cameron about why he thought his new film wasÂ the lowest rated movie on IMDB, but I heard back from his people and apparently he found something I wrote yesterday âterribly disappointingâ and called it off â which I found weird given that I didnât work yesterday.* But in case youâre wondering what itâs like to be vetted by Kirk Cameronâs people, it goes something like this:  SEK is being interviewed by Kirk Cameronâs Handler (KCH) for a potential article.KCH:Â Kirk wants to know if you have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, Christ the Savior.SEK:Â I attended CCD for a few years and studied Latin in college. I translated a lot of the Church Fathers â Augustine, Aquinas, and the like.KCH:Â Thatâs really interesting, really. So you know about sin?SEK:Â I know more than anyone cares to about the danger stealing pears from your neighbor can pose for your soul.KCH:Â So you were raised Catholic?Â SEK:Â Catholic and Jewish.KCH:Â You know Hebrew?Â SEK:Â Passably.KCH:Â Kirkâs a big fan of Hebrew, big fan.Â SEK:Â Itâs the only dead language to be revived.KCH:Â I didnât know that, did not know. Thatâs really interesting. Are you gay?SEK:Â I am not.KCH:Â Good, good, just need to dot those âtâs. Have you ever been gay?SEK:Â I have not, but Iâm not sure how thatâs relevant to my ability to discuss film. Did you read the links I sent?KCH:Â I did, and they were great, great. Loved them, loved. But some of the language was not quite Christ-like.Â SEK:Â I can adapt to my audience â weâve been talking for twenty minutes and I havenât cussed once.KCH:Â Thatâs true, true. Good. What are your feelings about âgotchaâ interviews?SEK:Â They get you one good moment, but burn your reputation for being fair-minded to people you disagree with.Â KCH:Â So you donât like them? Hate them?SEK:Â I canât do my job if people donât trust me to treat them fairly.KCH:Â That sounds fair, really fair. How do you think this is going?Â SEK:Â Pretty good.Â KCH:Â I think so too. I think we can make this work. I like you.SEK:Â Thanks. I like to be likable.KCH:Â Which is why Iâm worried about the state of your soul, but we can talk about that later.Â SEK:Â Do I need to be saved to do the interview?Â KCH:Â Kirk would definitely be more comfortable, definitely.Â SEK:Â ?KCH:Â Definitely.SEK:Â ?KCH:Â Let me pass this on to Kirk, and Iâll let you know.  *I did however writeÂ thisÂ on Facebook and I suppose he couldâve found that offensive.
