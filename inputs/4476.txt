Christian Marclay’s cassette tape cyanotype The young-and-impressive online journalÂ AmodernÂ has just released its new special issue on “The Poetry Series,” featuring articles on literary archives, archival organizational structures, transcoding, “paraphonotextuality,” the poetry-reading-as-medium, computational literary analysis, oral history, communal soundscapes, and other fascinating things — all put into context with a wonderful response by Marjorie Perloff. Among the articles is a conversation between Christine Mitchell and me about sound archives and media archaeology. It was fun.
