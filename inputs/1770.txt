Kevin Smith (Duke University) has written a post introducing the new Fair Use Index released by the U.S. Copyright Office. The index, which will be updated and expanded by the Copyright Office, contains searchable summaries of approximately 170 fair use cases in U.S. courts and, as Smith notes, doubles as a learning tool: “the best way to understand fair use, and to become comfortable with it, is too look closely at the cases, both in the aggregate and individually.” Smith takes a close look at what is or isn’t included in the index, and compares it to existing resources, including IP Watchdog and the Stanford Copyright & Fair Use site.
