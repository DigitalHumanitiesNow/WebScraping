On Tuesday, November 5, at 3:30 p.m., Professor William G. Thomas of the UNL Department of History will present on “The Digital Humanities as a Grand Challenge.” According to Professor Thomas, “The promise of the digital humanities is that it may be formulating theÂ strongestÂ basis for the future of the liberal arts in higher education today. It hasÂ undertaken one of the most important grand challenges we face: theÂ migration ofÂ the entire cultural record to digital form and the transformation ofÂ scholarlyÂ practices for the digital medium. Nearly twenty years in the open web, weÂ might ask how far we have come. And we might ask, given what has beenÂ accomplished (or hasn’t), whereÂ are we to go nextâin essence, what are the best opportunities forÂ significantÂ gains going forward?” The talk will be held in 110 Love Library (Love South). Â All are welcome to attend. Please spread the word!
