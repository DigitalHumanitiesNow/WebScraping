Yet in centuries past, philosophers and scholars had no trouble drawing conclusions about the intertwining of the political and the economic. One may immediately think of Karl Marx, whoâaccording to the above video from a new School of Life series on famous political theoristsâwas âcapitalismâs most famous and ambitious critic.â The practical effects of Marxâs political ideas may be anathema for good reason, Alain de Botton admits, but his economic analysis deserves continued attention.   //www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejJRhn53X2M   	   âCapitalism is going to have to be reformed,â de Botton says, âand Marxâs analyses are going to be part of any answer.â One might imagine many academics objecting to his certainty. Marxâs relevance is in question across the political spectrum, in part because the kind of capitalism he so painstakingly documented is hardly recognizable to us now. 70 yearsÂ before Marx diagnosed the social and economic ills of Victorian capitalism, Scottish philosopher Adam SmithÂ made similar observations of its 18th century precursor. Regularly cited in defense of so-called free market principles, SmithâsÂ Wealth of Nations as often shows how little freedom actually exists in capitalist societiesÂ because of the undue influence of âthe mastersâ and the hyper-specialization of the work force, who were unable in SmithâsÂ time, and often in ours, to organize for their mutual interests.   //www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-JQ17X6VNg   	   Smith may not have gone as far as Marx in his conclusions, but he did advocate progressive taxation and a robust welfare state. In the 20th century, John Rawls argued for a stricter standard of political and economic equality than Smithâs appeal to sympathy. Rawlsâ 1971Â Theory of JusticeÂ introducedÂ a âsimple, economical, and polemical way to show people how their societies were unfairâ: the âveil of ignorance.â ThisÂ thought experiment asks us to eliminate unfairnessÂ by presuming we might potentially have been born into the circumstances of any other living person on earth. Though it may not be particularly apparent, Rawlsâ ideas have had some influence on policy. As de Botton points out above, he dined regularly at the Clinton White House. But his principles havenât much changed the way we live our economic lives, in part because of his critique of the rags-to-riches story, almost a sacred myth in American society.   //www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJL9S0J8-4k   	   Like Adam Smith, Henry David Thoreauâs politics seem a little harder to pin down. A contemporary of Marx, Thoreau thought in terms of the individual, penning perhaps a founding text for both hippie homesteaders and survivalists. InÂ Waldenâwritten while he lived alone in a cabin on land owned by his friend and patron Ralph Waldo EmersonâThoreau makes the case for near total self-reliance. InÂ his Civil Disobedience, heÂ writes, âI heartily accept the mottoââThat government is best which governs least.ââ Thoreau also believed âThat government is best which governs not at all.â Yet, despite its authorâs fierce libertarian bent (he refused to pay his taxes on principle),Â Civil Disobedience has served a founding text of progressive social and environmental movements worldwide.Â Speaking âpractically and as a citizen, unlike those who call themselves no-government men,âÂ Thoreau went on, âI ask for, not at once no government, but at once a better government.â   //www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiNFoJqOJhs   	   De Bottonâs series on political theory profiles two more Victorian-era thinkersâpoet and writer on political economy William Morris, above,Â and art and literary critic John Ruskin, below. Both thinkersâwith rarified focus on craft and aestheticsâmade their own critiques of capitalism from positions of relative luxury. Though the School of Life series doesnât say so directly, it seems as though the six philosophers it surveysâvery cursorily, I should addâwere chosen as historical counterexamples to the ideaÂ thatÂ political theorists donât observe the relationship between the political and the economic. It may be the case today in certain academic departments, but it certainly was not for over the first two hundred years of capitalismâs existence.   //www.youtube.com/watch?v=x40l1ov8hfA   	   Related Content: David Harveyâs Course on MarxâsCapital: Volumes 1 & 2 Now Available Free Online Nietzsche, Wittgenstein & Sartre Explained with Monty Python-Style Animations by The School of Life Alain de Bottonâs School of Life Presents Animated Introductions to Heidegger, The Stoics & Epicurus Eastern Philosophy Explained with Three Animated Videos by Alain de Bottonâs School of Life Leo Strauss: 15 Political Philosophy Courses Online Free Online Philosophy Courses Josh JonesÂ is a writer and musician based in Durham, NC.
