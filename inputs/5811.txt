I was asked by a colleague who assigned some of my work to say something useful about the writing process for her grad students. Â Here’s the request:  my charge is to invite you to jot down in one paragraph any helpful thoughts you can offer about any aspect of the writing process–choosing a topic, figuring out the structure of a paper, strengthening an argument, structuring sentences, revising and fine-tuning, etc. Â   It’s kind of impossible not knowing them, but this is my attempt: The piece of writing advice I’ve found myself giving lately, more than anything else, is: “assume you’ve won.” Â So much writing in the humanities and critical social sciences is defensive–making sure an argument is protected from all comers. Â I understand that some aspects of both graduate school and journal reviewing lead to this way of doing things. Â But it’s not generally fun to read or write and it’s an impossible task. Â My teacher John Lie always said “even the best argument is full of holes.” Â What is fun is learning how to think differently about an old topic, or learning to think at all about aÂ new one. Â That’s why most of us get into being academics in the first place. Â Often when we are working through drafting new material we are still figuring out what we think as we are writing it (this is not true for everyone, but for a large portion of authors, including me). Â But in revision we get to both commit to a line of reasoning and to buildingÂ out its implications. Â So at that point, I try to write pedagogically and invitationally rather than defensively. Â I imagine that my audience is ready to hear what I have to say, now I have to take them through it. Â Of course this presupposes that one understands writing is a process, and that revision is where the magic happens. Â Revision isn’t really taught much in graduate school, but it should be. I hope this helps! PS–this entry was heavily revised (and I am resisting the urge to do more).
