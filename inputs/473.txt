After calling the app “Secret”, letting everyone who uses it think it’s secret, the founder of Secret now acknowledges that the information you submit is not, in fact, secret:  âThe thing we try to help people acknowledge is that anonymous doesnât mean untraceable,â David Byttow, chief executive and co-founder of the Secret, told Wired in an interview this week. âWe do not say that you will be completely safe at all times and be completely anonymous.â  I used Secret for a day, submitted one “secret”, realized it’s not good mojo and then assumed that in fact everything was traceable like everything else that’s digital, and so “deleted” my account. Who knows if it was really deleted. Make no mistake…Secret is one of the darkest of the dark patterns.
