This half-day, hands-on workshop aims to teach participants how to edit Wikipedia (our focus will be on womenâs history, but the skills apply to any subject matter). Participants will learn the policies governing the site, register as editors, begin editing the content of their choice, and leave confident in their abilities to revise text, add citations and insert images. Participants should bring a laptop or tablet to use during the workshop
