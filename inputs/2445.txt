This Spring 2015 Semester I will be teaching three courses, described as follows: English 6055: Multimodal Literature in the Digital Age  This course is concerned with multimodal literary expression in an age of digital mediaâa set of technologies which allow for the integrated representation of visual, textual, and aural information. The course will explore ways in which digital media can represent traditional literary texts beyond the capabilities of print by providing access to archival and manuscript materials in multimodal representations while offering new tools for their study. It will also investigate how digital media remediates and reinvents comics, placing them in conversation with born-digital genres, such as webcomics, HTML5 comics, memes, animated GIFs, and video games. The course will also survey genres of electronic literatureâlanguage-based engagements of digital mediaâs multimodal and programmable capabilities. Mondays, from 6:30 – 9:00 pm. Advanced undergraduate students welcomed! English 3325: Modern Poetry  This course will explore Modernism as a poetic movement with antecedents in the 19th Century, a chief lines of development during the early to mid 20th Century, a counter-movement in the second half of the 20th Century, and a poetics that continues into the 21st century, with Digital Modernism. Special attention will be given to the major works and literary schools collectively understood to be part of the Modern poetic literary movements in English and American literature.
