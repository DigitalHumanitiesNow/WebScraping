Regular users of EEBO-TCP may have noticed that the corpus recently grew by a few thousand texts. As of March 2014, 3,913 new titles have been released, bringing the total number of texts in Phase II to 22,971! The complete EEBO-TCP corpus (Phases I and II together) now contains 48,339 books. These new titles are already available in the University of Michigan EEBO-TCP interface, and will soon be synced to the University of Oxford platform. To explore the titles in the most recent batch, visit the Michigan interface linked above and try a bibliographic search for ‘2013-12′ in the citation: A screenshot of the EEBO-TCP search interface, demonstrating how to find the latest batch of texts by searching for the date 2013-12 in the citation field. Authorized users who use the EEBO-TCP XML-encoded text files for local research may already access this new batch via Box.com. (If you would like access to these filesâfor example, as the basis for a new edition you’re working on, or as a dataset for a text mining projectâplease contact us!) The new texts should also appear in EEBO after ProQuest’s next update, scheduled for June 2014.
