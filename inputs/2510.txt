         Well, I’ve been neglecting this blog, but I haven’t neglected blogging altogether.  Last academic year, I contributed six writings on digital-humanities topics to the Townsend Blog at the Townsend Center for the Humanities, UC Berkeley. Here is a quick summary, with links.                   In the fall, I focused on institutions that have made contributions to the digital humanities:  Digital Humanities Profiles: Innovations in the Capital Region (2012 Sept. 20)This entry profiles three DH institutions, all in or near the Washington D.C. area. I don’t venture to guess why DH has flourished there, though the proximity of these institutions to one another can’t have hurt. (In this so-called digital age, the ability to meet face-to-face is still valuable.)   Some Rights Reserved: A Brief Introduction to the Creative Commons (2012 Oct. 15)Though not explicitly or primarily DH, the Creative Commons project is something like a close cousin.  In this post, I muse on the affinity.    All Mimsy were the Borogoves: A Brief Introduction to the Unicode Standard (2012 Nov. 15)To those of us who use non-Western languages, the Unicode project is extremely important. Here, I discuss a bit of its history and the nature of its contribution. Also, this entry and the next one underline the sometimes overlooked importance of standardization to the recent generation of DH-related technologies.   The Text Encoding Initiative: Allowing Preservation and Access to our Textual Heritage through Digital Means (2013 Jan. 22)Following in the vein of institutions and standards, this post introduces the Text Encoding Initiative, which endeavors to maintain standards for marking up our textual heritage.  In the spring I shifted gears, discussing some exciting DH events closer to home:  Three Weeks with Dan Cohen: A DH Microcosm (2013 March 1)In this post, I reflect on the delightful experience I had with Dan Cohen, during his visit as the Townsend Avenali Resident Fellow in History.   Creating Collaborative Data Space: a Profile of the New Social Sciences Data Laboratory (2013 April 18)Dan Cohen’s visit coincided with the opening of our new Social Sciences Data Lab.  I was happy to have a small role in D-Lab’s inaugural semester, and in this post, I celebrate D-Lab’s opening and reflect on the relationship of humanities and the social sciences, especially where digital research methods are involved.  If I had to sum up these posts, I’d say their central themes are the importance of standardization, the role of community and collaboration, and the merits of a ‘big-tent’ approach to DH.
