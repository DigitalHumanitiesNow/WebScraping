Having talked about Mendeley's OA deposit rates in my last blog post, I thought it worthwhile to check how representative my chosen discipline (Computer Science) was. Rather than download the entire community for each other discipline, I have performed a quick and dirty sample of some of the available literature in each discipline using the search function. Each Mendeley search result offers the option of saving the PDF (if available) to your library, so it is a simple matter to wget some search results and grep for PDFs.The table below shows the results of this procedure for 11 disciplines (two illustrative keywords each). The "available PDFs" column records the number of PDFs offered on the first page of the search results (each page contains 200 results); the total number of results shows the relative coverage of the topic in Mendeley.Computer Science appears to be in the 5-10% range of OA (18 or 11 PDFs out of a page of 200 results) which does seem to be just about average. Social Science, Medicine, Health Science, Economics and the Humanities appear to have fewer PDFs and Maths and Physics appear to have rather more.Search termDisciplineAvailable PDFsTotal ResultschromatographyChem1014260crystallographyChem274921JAVACS18848softwareCS1115185geologyEarth364180hydrodynamicEarth402853econometricsEconomics13565microeconomicsEconomics588biodiversityEnv144668climateEnv1413003nursingHealth610723palliativeHealth61978archaeologyHum61730FoucaultHum11248algebraMath1014424cohomologyMath171525cancerMed1152315pharmacologyMed462285quasarPhys127556telescopePhys1012347cognitionPsy1118805schizophreniaPsy174055criminologySocSci2154sociologySocSci22005
