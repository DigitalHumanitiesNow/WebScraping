  P22 Type Foundry recently announced a new series of fonts, Staunton Scripts, part of the Sherwood Type Collection. P22 already has some great fonts ideal for history websites, and this collection adds a few more. Here are a few of my favorites:  1722 Roman -- "An historical font based on early 18th century printing, with the visual effect of uneven inking and indifferent presswork on handmade paper. Ideal for evoking the period. Effective in continuous text setting or in display sizes."  Chatham -- "Chatham is part of the "Staunton Script Family" of fonts designed by Ted Staunton for his historic novel centered around a family bible and the handwritten annotation through 7 generations."  Grenville.  Roanoke Script -- "A hand-written script inspired by 18th century forms. The visual effect is of a steel nib pen writing on uncalendered paper."  Virginian.  I'm always looking for more fonts, so let me know if you have any favorites.
