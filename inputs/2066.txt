The Association of College & Research Libraries launched today a new current awareness publication titled "Keeping Up With...." The goal is to offer "concise briefs on trends in academic librarianship and  higher education. Each edition focuses on a single issue including an  introduction to the topic and summaries of key points, including  implications for academic libraries."The inaugural issue features the topic Digital Humanities. David Free, editor, contacted Jennifer Adams and I in January to ask if we would be interested in doing an update of our Internet Resources article in the October issue of College & Research Libraries News.  That article received good reviews and and large number of hits.  A couple of new developments worth mentioning since October:Information on starting Digital Humanities projects and centers:  Appleford, S, Guiliano, J.
