In this paper we shall explore the possibilities opened in the         digital scholarship of Ancient Greek literature. We shall focus on the Homeric         Catalogue of Ships (Il. 2.484-759), as it is a text that calls for a series of different         scholarly approaches, and try to identify and present the use of the appropriate digital         tools to accomplish these approaches.
