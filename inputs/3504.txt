Starting in August and for the academic year 2014-2015, I’ll be a Visiting Fellow at CUNY Grad Center’s Advanced Research Collaborative in New York. I’ll be working on a new book project and I’m excited to be part of the excellent DH group at CUNY, of ARC, and of the Grad Center as a whole, and to participate in the larger DH community in New York for the year.
