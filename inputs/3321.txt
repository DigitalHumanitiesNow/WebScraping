It's been that sort of a week.  Great beginning with the inauguration on Tuesday and the start of a new Obama presidency.  My wife was in tears.  Growing up in a small southern town, she never imagined she'd see a black president, and now our youngest daughter will never know a world in which there hasn't been one.  Sometimes things do change for the better.On a personal note, I gave my notice to UNC on Tuesday.  My position was partially funded with soft money, and one-time money is one of the primary ways they're trying to address the budget crisis, in order not to lay off permanent employees (as is right and proper).  I'm rather sad about leaving, but I will be starting a job with the NYU digital library team in February, working on digital papyrology.  This has the look of a job where I can unite both the Classics geek and the tech geek sides of my personality.  I may become unbearable.
