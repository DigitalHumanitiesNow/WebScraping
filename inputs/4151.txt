Deciding on the art direction was incredibly challenging for this painting and we all spent a lot of one on one time with Bosch. One of the key aspects of our game is that we are attempting to bring the garden to life in 3D. We realized that our initial instinct of being as true to the painting as possible might be very strange, and not in a good way, in a dimensional world. We also had to consider the sheer size of the thing. Even though this game will be downloaded and not streamed, we still have to keep it reasonable.The first issue was the style itself. We had a number of great ideas from using marionette figures for NPCs and envisioning the world as a stage to grungy betting dens in Gamblerâs Hell. In the end, we decided that Bosch was describing how tempting worldly issues are. Bosch seems to be saying that the material world is misleading; if you look to it for spiritual guidance then there is no escape from a lengthy stay in purgatory. We felt this was an important feel to capture and so decided that the art style should attempt to capture a push-pull between the tempting yet morally distracting worldly pleasures. The Hell, or purgatory, panel should be attractive and enticing, the evil hidden underneath. This means that instead of a grungy gambling den, the Gamblerâs Hell should beckon like the Vegas strip â in a 16thcentury Bosch sort of way. Our central concept is that the material world of the game should create tension, or a push-pull, in the player between being mesmerized by the physical beauty of the world and repulsion from their own understanding of morality. 3D "cards" made from painting groups and figures will be used for background assets.When looking at the painting, one of the interesting things, at least in the Hell panel, is that the human figures appear homogenous, almost interchangeable or archetypal. It seems to be the demons and monsters that have all the personality. This made it easy to take a modular approach to human NPC models. We could use the same body type and swap out a few features. We would spend our resources focusing on bringing the demons to life.  NPCs will be fully modeled.Occulus Rift Part of the team is experimenting with the Occulus Rift. They will be taking assets and game play from the PC version for a VR experience. With that in mind, we are trying to design player interaction methods that will work with both platforms. This means re-thinking how user interface (UI) elements such as journals and inventory would work. The current idea for the inventory UI is that it will be a bubble that references the monochromatic glove on the exterior of the triptych. Player will be able to see inventory items and access them from the bubble interface.Concepts for UI, abstracted bubble on black background Previous Bosch Post
