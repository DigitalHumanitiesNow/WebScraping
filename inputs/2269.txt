As a teacher, there’s nothing more satisfying than learning from your students and sitting back as they show you how well they can critically evaluate the material and bring new insights to it. Here below I have placed (with permissions) a few short excerpts from my students’ final projects, completed for theÂ Rhetoric and Digital Media course on Technology and the Human Body, ENG/COM 395. . Jayne Goethe’s Final Project, titled “My Body Full of Sound” Statement: âMy Body, Full of Soundâ is an art piece created to illustrate and expandÂ Â Â Â  uponÂ the possibilities resulting from a transition from human to posthumanÂ Â Â Â  realities. Inspired by the work in posthuman theory by Tim Lenoir andÂ Â Â Â  N. Katherine Hayles,Â the piece analyzes the role of contemporary music,Â Â Â Â  particularly contemporaryÂ techno and pop genres, as a reflection andÂ Â Â Â  generator of posthuman sensibilities. Hayles contends that our path toÂ Â Â Â  becoming posthuman will be through the process she terms âintermediation,âÂ Â Â Â  in which a series of integrated feedback loopsÂ  between us and ourÂ Â Â Â  technological devices, media, texts, and immersions will prepare and guideÂ Â Â Â  us towards a new all-digital future (Lenoir 3). Hayles argues furtherÂ that itÂ Â Â Â  is through metaphor, narrative, and âother interpretive linguistic modesâÂ Â Â Â  that we will be conditioned for and directed towards this new world, as theseÂ Â Â  modes are considered primary tools for understanding and imagining the worldÂ Â Â Â  surrounding us (3). Through a multimedia approach, âMy Body, Full of SoundâÂ Â Â Â  aimsÂ to illustrate and support Hayles' concept of intermediation, consideringÂ Â Â  contemporary music a narrative-based âinterpretive linguistic modeâ that isÂ Â Â Â  anticipatory of, if not influential in, the transition to a posthuman world.Â Â Â  VIDEO CLIP IMAGES:Â  The video flashes behind and within the character's heads transforming theÂ Â Â  still frames into animated video. The flash and distortion of the imagesÂ Â Â  reeled to theÂ music reference the simultaneous and endless bombardment ofÂ Â Â  information receivedÂ  in a pervasive computing environment like the one weÂ Â Â  live in todayâan interconnected environment of GPS systems, smart phones,Â Â Â  and the internetâand the ones of theÂ future being imagined and developed byÂ Â Â  the scientists mentioned in Lenoir'sÂ article, in which mechanical interfacesÂ Â Â  are erased altogether (20).Â Â Â   COVER ART:Â Â Â  Visuals gives face and color to the characters in the musicalÂ  narrative.Â Â Â  Each of the eight models was photographed twiceâone full bodyÂ shot and oneÂ Â  headshotâassuming a blank, uninvolved pose. Such a pose isÂ intended to conveyÂ Â  the potentially emotionally neutralizing impact constant interaction andÂ Â  integration within an âenvironment of ubiquitous computingÂ technologyâ mayÂ Â  cause (15). Additionally, each model is wearing the sameÂ headphones, aÂ Â  symbolic indication that all characters are plugged into aÂ singularÂ Â  digital-sonic realm.  POEM: [Crash] an interludeÂ Â Â  My body, its sound carriesÂ Â Â  as I crawl into the space[s]Â Â Â  fight tight all the screensÂ Â Â  [life tearing at the seams]Â Â Â  I am listeningÂ Â Â  my name is Listening.Â Â Â   The character first describes her connection with sound as an embodiedÂ Â  experienceâit is her body that emanates and âcarriesâ sound. A screenÂ Â Â Â  interface of some sort is then introduced, the character compelled toÂ Â Â Â  âfightâ this screen, an attempt to withhold the body from the convolutingÂ Â Â  force of the technological interface. The poem suggests that it is theÂ Â Â Â  destiny and power of technology to tear life âat the seams,â executing theÂ Â Â Â  separation and distillation of the physical body into its purely digitalÂ Â Â Â  form, posthuman at last. Hence, listening is transferred from an embodiedÂ Â Â  actââI am listeningââto a disembodied state, the name âListening.âÂ Â  Â   Michael Evans' Final Project: "Floating Lotus"Â Â   IMAGE: Â  STATEMENT:Â Â  âFloating Lotusâ is a demonstration of the potential technologyÂ Â  has ofÂ expanding not only physical and mental capabilities, but alsoÂ spiritualÂ  capabilities. Transhumanism only acknowledges the breadth of humanÂ potentialÂ  by viewing technology as a prosthetic for the human body and mind.Â Â Â  âBreadthâÂ is herein defined as the range of capabilities of the humanÂ Â Â  experience such as enhanced motor skills, memory, knowledge, and intellect.  On the other hand, âdepthâ can be defined as everythingÂ Â  intrinsic to that humanÂ experience such as subjective consciousness andÂ Â  profoundÂ  religious experience. The artwork manifests James Hughesâ argumentÂ Â  that technologies can be adopted to enhance human spirituality. In one ofÂ  his lectures, he states, âTranshumanism appears to be especially compatibleÂ  withÂ religious traditionsÂ that emphasize human agency and evolution to aÂ Â Â  transcendent state, such asÂ  Buddhism, or that have incorporated EnlightenmentÂ  values, such as liberal Christianity.â This âtrans-spiritualityâ that HughesÂ Â Â  claims is in line withÂ the argument that technologies suitably enhance orÂ  have the potential toÂ  enhance the depth of the human psyche...Â Â   Other libertiesÂ  takenÂ by the artist include the decision to give the workÂ  aÂ âretroâ or âsteam-punkâ feel by utilizing black and white as well asÂ  the ENIAC computer.Â  This computer was a landmark in digital computing asÂ  well asÂ a spark of theÂ modern information age. The exposed wires andÂ  interconnectedness of the computer emphasizes the symbiotic relationshipÂ  between man and machine. By happenstance, the image created the shape ofÂ  a light bulb at the top,Â suggesting the boy achieved enlightenment whileÂ  demonstrating the older metaphor humans had of seeing their bodies asÂ  electrical machines.Â   Â   Thomas Campbell, "Rhetoric of the Comic Body"Â   STATEMENT:Â  From Superman and Spider-man to the Sunday funnies comicsÂ Â  historically haveÂ been a form interested in the human body. The bodiesÂ Â  that live within theÂ panels of comics however play by their own rules.Â Â  The form can at once beÂ celebratory of the human form and transformingÂ Â  it into something that few wouldÂ  call human. A good comic can come toÂ Â  life on the page and stretch the limits ofÂ what is considered real.  This Jason page shows how using animal characters matted on a human form can lessen the bodily affect tied to the characters’ more extreme actions–in this case violence. This sequence would read as horrific, if it were rendered realistically with a human doing the same action. Jason’s deadpan delivery also plays up the fact that it isn’t to be taken gravely. The comics medium emphasizes a certain elasticity of the human form; aÂ Â  freedomÂ from the constrains of realism. The cartoonist is able to use theÂ Â  human body asÂ a spring board for their figures, at times to create creaturesÂ  that areÂ simultaneously identifiable and foreign...The human form isÂ Â  frequently at theÂ forefront of comics story telling, but the nature of theÂ Â  medium allows theÂ  human form to become something not seen is everyday life.Â Â  The body can become a symbol for action or emotion. It can be a stand me forÂ Â  one's self or another. In a medium where as much happens in what is seen asÂ Â  in what is not seen, theÂ  possibilities are limitless; and the definition ofÂ Â  the body is ever changing.Â Â   PROJECT SLIDES: See images and descriptions inÂ  the comments line:Â Â  Thomas Campbell Comics Slide Show
