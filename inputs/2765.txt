People, outside of academia, often ask me what Environmental History is and why I study it instead of, say, the Revolution, the Civil War, or World War II (the most commonly referenced histories). Most of the time,  I am at a loss about how to respond to their questions. Generally I mumble something about the environment as playing a very important and specific role in shaping our American History and leave it at that. Of course, this is not necessarily fair to them, or me, or for EH in general. Now I have an answer â¦ memories of my childhood, roaming the Diamond 4 ranch with my border collie, Mark, in tow and a .22 in hand. Those memories remain with me always, and thus I have a strong connection to my history and the very important environments that shaped that history. This photo, taken last October on a ranch tour with my Dad, I think best illustrates that connection. I spent many hours and days wandering through those trees under sunny, blue skies. To answer the question, I study what I study because it connects me to my past and thus our past.
