Finally for the day, another announcement that’s been slightly delayed: I’m really pleased to be part of the SSHRC-funded, McGill-led NovelTM: Text Mining the Novel project. It’s a long-term effort “to produce the first large-scale cross-cultural study of the novel according to quantitative methods” (quoth the About page). A super-impressive group of people are attached – just have a look at the list of team members! Our first all-hands project meeting is coming up this week. Looking forward to getting started on things that will keep me busy for years to come. Updates and preliminary results here in the months ahead.Filed under: Digital Humanities, Literature, Meta
