Every album by The Wrens so far has turned out to be a time capsule prophecy of my life in the decade to follow â  just open it up ten years later, listen to it again, and it turns out there was your whole life, written for you by a band’s songwriters who’d already gone there and were sending you a message back, like constellations five to ten light years away, only it went in reverse, and you are actually seeing the future in the stars. Superluminal astronauts desperate to get a message back to the past, and the only way is through slightly overwrought guitar pop songs.  They’re releasing another one, signed with a label, recording is almost done.  Their fans may be few, but we are loyal and we are mighty, and we have been making ourselves ready, here on the other side of the universe.  Call it dad rock if you want. I, for one, am anxious to learn what my forties will be like, and grateful to know that if the pattern holds, no matter what happens, at least I’ll live that long.
