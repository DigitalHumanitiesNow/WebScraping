A new Colloquy, over at Arcade, features my remarks from the roundtable, “What is Data in Literary Studies?” which took place at the 2014 MLA convention the other week. The panel was organized by Jim English, and also featured remarks by Eric Hayot, Scott Selisker, Peter Logan, David Alworth, and Heather Houser. A Storify of the related tweets can be found here.
