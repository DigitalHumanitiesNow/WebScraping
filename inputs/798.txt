Whatâs most striking about Leon Wieseltierâs essay in the New York Times Book review is how it confirms almost every clichÃ© about the humanities as technophobic, insular, and reactionary. Not to mention some stereotypes about grouchy old men. Now I should confess at the outset to being a longtime Wieseltier cynic. His misreadings of popular culture always seemed mildly ridiculous. But whatâs striking about the NYT piece is hisÂ vast ignorance of the subject. Wieseltier writing about digital humanities is like Maureen Dowd writing about hash brownies. Note to New York Times editorial writers: show a remote understand of the subject. Your ignorance is not a cultural crisis. This line in particular, caught my eye: âSoon all the collections in all the libraries and all the archives in the world will be available to everyone with a screen.â Really? On what planet? Perhaps Wieseltier was thinking of this 1999 Qwest commercial for internet service? Now Iâm a specialist in Japanese history, and Iâm certain that the millions of pages of handwritten early-modern documents in archives across Japan will not be all online âsoon.â But even assumingÂ that for Wieseltier âall the librariesâ might mean modern publications in English, French and Hebrew, this is just nonsense. Has Wieseltier noted the metadata problems on Google Books? Or would understanding the limits to digitization be too much to ask? Whatâs tragic about Wieseltierâs mindless opposition of the humanities versus technology it that it precludes exactly what we should be teaching: how to employ critical thinking when using technology. Dan Edlestein has a marvelous essay exploring how to search for the concept of âthe Enlightenment.â His piece shows how, first, one canât do aÂ search without a basic understanding of the history of the Enlightenment itself, second, that quirky results are more thanÂ âmistakes.â Parsing weird and unstable search results can inform our understanding both of digital technologies and the history of ideas. The need forÂ critical thinking inÂ database searches actually proves the ongoing relevance of humanities in the internet age. Of course, at the heart ofÂ Wieseltierâs panic is the “decline of the humanities.” Too bad Wieseltier doesnât read the Atlantic. The humanities arenât in decline. âThe same percentage of men (7 percent) major in the humanities today as in the 1950s.â The overall drop over that period came from women, who began to pursue careers in the sciences because of the end of institutional gender bias. But that analysis came from the great digital humanities researcher Ben Schmidt. And understanding it would require taking both numbers and genderÂ seriously. Which apparently is something great humanistic minds need not do.
