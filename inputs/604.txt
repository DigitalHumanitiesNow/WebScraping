I finally got around to playing with sample data I collected on a research trip last summer. The data comes from the Rockford Chair and Furniture Company Records at Northern Illinois University. The most exciting part of this is that these visualizations were orders from one day, November 5, 1891, and they have several years of this data so there is much more potential in these records. I found Gephi quite easy to use and I’d recommend taking a look at it if you’re interested in making your own. Orders by cityOrders organized by which railroad they were shippedOrders georeferencedFor those geographically challengedP.S. There’s a typo on two of the images, just pretend I know how to spelled “furniture” correctly.
