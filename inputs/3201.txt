Learning is a stunt. We learn best when asked (or when we ask ourselves) to do something at first unimaginable. This is exactly the reason I&rsquo;ve begun to wonder whether classrooms should be made to look more like reality cooking shows. On these shows, tasks (like the &ldquo;Quickfire challenge&rdquo; on Top Chef) have discrete parameters, sometimes only vaguely defined. &ldquo;In 20 minutes, you will make _____ using _____ without doing _____.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s often as simple as that. The tasks are not mapped for contestants. There are no examples, rubrics, or assessment criteria. The chefs are given a space, ingredients, and tools, but they are not given elaborate instructions. They are not told which tools to use or how to use them. After a 20-minute flurry of chopping and fire, the chefs are not evaluated objectively, nor are they scored on some predetermined scale. The judges pick the winner by taste, noting their impressions -- their subjective experience -- of the food. Meanwhile, viewers judge the contestants by the character of their flurry, the keen slice of their knife, the quips they spit as they juggle arugula and salmon meat.
