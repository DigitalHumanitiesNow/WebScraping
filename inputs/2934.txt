The sixth annual conference of the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association (OASPA) will be held in France for the first time, at UNESCO in Paris, on 17â19 September 2014. OpenEdition is delighted to support OASPA as official sponsor of the 2014 conference. Pierre Mounier, OpenEditionâs deputy director, will be present at this event. Founded in 2008, OASPAâs objective is to support and represent the interests of open access journal and book publishers in all academic disciplines, by: defining quality and best practice criteria; supporting the development of economic and editorial models that favour the dissemination of publications in open access; raising awareness about the values and principles of open access among the academic community and general public. The association is open to professional open access publishers, whether commercial or non-profit (research libraries, university presses, etc.), as well as to all institutions that work in the domain of open access publishing. OpenEdition has been a member of OASPA since 2012. Check the preliminary programme of the conference on OASPA’s website — Read this post in French
