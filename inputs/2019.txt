Although it is obvious that digital research methods have broadened our options for observing and understanding historical objects and processes, there is still few discussion on how to prepare, publish, and communicate scientific results based on digital tools and data. In my contribution I'm going to argue that the adoption of digital research methods has far reaching consequences for the justification of scientific claims. As an example, I will present the findings of the Digital Pantheon Project concerning the design and construction of the Pantheon's portico columns and will discuss how the project attempts to justify its findings. The experiences made with the Pantheon Project can be summarized in a requirements catalogue for digital investigation methods, which also might be relevant for other research projects.
