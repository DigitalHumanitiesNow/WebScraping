I had set up a blog for Kevin Shupe on the ClioWeb server a while back and had forgotten about it, until Sheila noticed.    Presenting Polyphonous Pasts, a weblog that explores the idea of polyphonous pasts, or the idea that "multiple unresolved narratives can be woven together to produce a historical view that is more self-reflective." Good luck, Kevin, and welcome to the blogosphere.
