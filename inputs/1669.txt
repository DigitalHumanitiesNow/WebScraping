The 2015 Tiltfactor team is bigger and bolder than ever. Dr. Mary Flanagan and her team are currently gathering data in a “Study-Palooza,” our term for enthusiastic and dedicated data collection. This awesome team is focused on the Bioheritage Diversity Library, Metadata Games, Bystander Intervention, Climate Change, and equity in STEM learning, just to name a few themes! Meanwhile, MONARCH and games for Robert Wood Johnson (Gut Check, Bill of Health) are en route to the printers. . .
