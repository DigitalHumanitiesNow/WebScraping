Many of the good things we love about language are essentially hierarchical. Narrative is linear: a beginning, middle, and end.Â Order shapes the story. Hierarchy gives a birdâs eye view, a table of contents, a summary that allows a reader to consider a work as a whole. Lila will compute hierarchy by comparing passages on word qualities that suggest order. Concreteness is considered a good candidate. Passages with more abstract words express ideas and concepts, whereas passages with more concrete words express examples. Of the views that Lila can suggest, it is useful to have a view thatÂ presents abstract concepts first and concrete examples second. I have listed four candidate qualities here, but I will focus in the posts that follow on concreteness.  Quality Description Examples 1 Abstract Intangible qualities, ideas and concepts.Â Different than frequency of word usage. Both academic terms and colorful prose can have low word frequency. freedom (227*), justice (307), love (311)  Concrete Tangible examples, illustrations and sensory experience grasshopper (660*), tomato (662), milk (670) 2 General Categories and groupings.Â Similar to 1, but 1 is more dichotomous and this one is more of a range. furniture  Specific Particular instances La-Z-Boy rocker-recliner 3 Logical Analytical thinking, understatement and fact.Â Note the conflict with 1 and 2 — facts are both logical and concrete. The fastest land dwelling creature is the Cheetah.  Emotional/Sentimental Feeling, emphasis, opinion. Can take advantage of the vast amount of sentiment measures available. The ugliest sea creature is the manatee. 4 Static Constancy and passivity It was earlier demonstrated that heart attacks can be caused by high stress.  Dynamic Change and activity. Energy. Researchers earlier showed that high stress can cause heart attacks. * Concreteness index. MRC Psycholinguistic database.Â Grasshopper is a more concrete word than freedom.Â Indexes like the MRC can be used to compute concreteness for passages. Lila can compute hierarchy for passages, and for groups of passages. Together, it builds a hierarchy, a view of how the content can be organized. Think of what this offers a writer. A writer stuck in his or her manually produced categories and view can ask Lila for alternate views. Lila “tears down” the old categories and suggests a new way of looking at the content. It is unlikely that the writer will stick exactly to Lila’s view, but it could provide a fresh start or give new insight. AndÂ Lila can compute new views dynamically, on demand, as the content changes.
