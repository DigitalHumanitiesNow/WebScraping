This weekend Iâm attending the 20th anniversary conference for the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media. In the honorable tradition of spending time at DH conferences to build projects, a team of people from the center (including students in my Programming for Historians Class) built a visualization of the many people who have worked at RRCHNM and the projects that they worked on. The data was drawn from the exhibit of the Centerâs work and people created for the anniversary. Considering that in one day the collaborators conceptualized the project, gathered the data from the API, cleaned the data, visualized it, wrote up some explanatory text, and published a website, I think it was a good dayâs work.
