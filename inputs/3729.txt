 This was the space I travelled — frequently — at this time last year. Â Tonight, Carrie and I dine with a friend at Chez Panisse (the cheap part) and tomorrow we fly to Los Angeles for the Experience Music Project Pop Conference at UCLA. Â I remember that I kept asking the doctors whether I’d be able to make it to California, and they kept saying yes.
