Catalogue of Digitized Medieval Manuscripts: My site, with Chris Baswell. Â It indexes and links to almost 3000 manuscripts, digitized in their entirety. Â Weâre working on funding for a second version of the site, which will hopefully accommodate all of the manuscripts added to the web since the site launched just over two years ago.
