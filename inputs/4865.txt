Users can now publish a new type of academic event on Calenda: summer schools. Hybrid and international sites of learning In order to fully represent upcoming events in research and scholarly output and exchange, Calendaâs scientific board has decided to add another string to its bow: summer schools. Summer schools are booming and represent a hybrid form of learning â a cross between colloquia, workshops and training sessions. At the intersection between theoretical exploration and practical research, summer schools allow masterâs and doctoral students to examine their work alongside that of experienced academics. Summer schools also internationalise research by bringing together students and researchers from different disciplines who speak different languages around common goals. They also provide a forum for fruitful discussion around issues and disciplines, particularly when methodological issues are particularly important. The digital humanities are therefore especially well suited to this type of academic event. Announce a summer school on Calenda If you would like to announce a summer school on Calenda, please complete the online suggestion form. The announcement should include the following information: a detailed call for proposals registration details and information on selection of papers registration fees participating speakers a provisional programme, where possible. The date assigned to the announcement will be the registration deadline for the summer school. If registration for the summer school is open â with participants sometimes being selected for a project that will discussed throughout the summer school â the school itself will generally be considered a non-public event. In this case it will appear in the humanities and social sciences calendar once the deadline for the call for proposals has passed. If some lectures during the summer school are open to the public, they can be published in another announcement, as a âlecture seriesâ. As always, it is possible to add further details to an announcement that has already been published by asking the Calenda team to upload the full programme. This means your announcement will always be perfectly in step with your summer school! — Read this post in EnglishRead this post in Portuguese
