One of the nice things about WorldCat is that is has sufficient scale to be a good proxy for a large part of the scholarly and cultural record. The aggregate holdings of thousands of libraries contain not just books, but movies, music, and so on. It is not complete but it gives good results.  In honor of St Valentine's day, my colleagues JD Shipengrover and Diane Vizine-Goetz have produced a list of the most widely held love stories in libraries - the most widely held books and the most widely held movies.   Here are the lists ... It is interesting seeing the similarities between the two.

The data is clustered at the work level, to consolidate editions and so on. A little more context is at the list page.
