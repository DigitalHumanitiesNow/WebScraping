From Awaiting Armageddon: U.S. paralysis on civil defense could be credited to an inability to face the prospect of nuclear war or simply to a sense of futility. â¦ Intellectually, Americans knew the hazards of nuclear war, but America was not ready [during the Cuban Missile Crisis] â¦ The United States simply had refused to accept that war might erase or, at the very least, devastate the future. As a result, civil defense was kept on a back burner, partially because the nationâs leaders failed to tell the public the truth that the United States had little means of protecting its citizens from total war. This disconnection in the American psyche an inability to face the loss of the future that could result from rabid antiâCommunism left the nation vulnerable to war and to false claims of safety. Cold War culture taught Americans to fear, but it did not offer a refuge from the deadliest threat, nuclear attack (61). From âWhen Truth Is Stranger Than Fiction:â In November 1983 a routine NATO nuclear readiness exercise code-named Able Archer could have led to a Soviet nuclear strike against the West. What is remarkable about this possible Soviet strike is that it was perceived by the Soviets as a defensive and preâemptive strike. Therefore, the Soviets somehow believed that there was an impending Western nuclear attack that they had to preâempt. American rearmament, NATO missile deployment, and Reaganite rhetoric somehow convinced the Soviets that the nuclear endgame was near. These fears climaxed in November 1983 during a seemingly innocuous nuclear-readiness exercise by the West. It has been described by historian Christopher Andrew as one of the most dangerous moments of the Cold War. How many other such âmomentsâ exist?
