Pleased to announce LLCU 609, “Cultural Analytics: The Computational Study of Culture.” It offers an overview of the field, with an emphasis on text analysis, stylistics, sentiment analysis, topic modelling, social network analysis and visual culture. So far we have eight different disciplines represented in a class of about 18 students. Nice to see how interdisciplinary this work is. The syllabus can be accessed here.
