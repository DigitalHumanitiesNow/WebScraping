Does anyone have any suggestions on a good reliable WebDAV product for Vista 64bit?  I can not get the one that is bundled with Vista to work.  Every time I try to create a remote connection I get the following error message:  "The folder you entered does not appear to be valid"   I have run the Vista WebDAV patches: KB907306  I have also tried the following Hotfix: Windows Vista WebDAV Hotfix  I have also tried to get various 3rd party packages working such as Independent DAV, BitKinex and WebDrive.  All of the WebDAV products seem to have problems with the Windows Vista 64 bit systems.  Is there any way to get Vista to use the Windows XP WebDAV "drivers"?  I am using both eXist and MarkLogic native XML databases.  Thanks - Dan
