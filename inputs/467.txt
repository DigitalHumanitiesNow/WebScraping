Lots of folks I talk to about building products want to know how to grow from a tiny initial user base (10 people) up through 100 to 1000. It certainly seems like each of these stages is different, but it’s not clear why. I recently thought a lot about this when interviewed by Jay Acunzo of Nextview Ventures. My take is that the reason why these are fundamentally different stages is because of the relationship you have with these people…in short it comes down to bias:  “Initially when you start, you can talk to friends and get them excited about what youâre working on. These people are your co-workers, friends, and family so theyâre easy to find and talk to. But they are also completely biased…” We also touched on a lot of other topics like what features to build, when to focus on product vs. growth, etc. Here is the entire interview.  FYI: I’m writing a new book on how to communicate your product or service called Make them Care!. If you would like to be reminded when it comes out, sign up here.
