 I have a post up today on the new Bearings blog of the new BTS Center. Teaser below, but head to the Bearings blog for the full post. Considering the amount of online commentary available concerning the millennial generation and the future of the church, the relative dearth of attention paid to young adultsâ experience of faith and college is surprising. After all, college changes people. The 18-year-old who steps foot on campus during orientation week is, as students today would say, âsuper differentâ from the graduate four-plus years later. Among other changes, studentsâ faith claims shift over that time. Perhaps for the first time in their lives, college students must make active decisions about whether and how to live out their faith without the support of their parents. Academic study pushes students to engage lifeâs big questions of existence, life together, and how to get a job. Further, the diversity of views students encounter in collegeâboth religious and secularâcan lead students to ask a wide range of questions themselves: – What am I supposed to do with my life? – Is that girl/boy into me? – What do you mean Paul didnât write Ephesians? – How is that atheist in my philosophy class so darn nice? – What will my parents say if they find out Iâm gay? When I was in seminary, I remember taking education classes that focused on childhood development, emphasizing learning stages and the appropriate programming for congregational life. When it came to address college-aged students, though, the class trailed off. We each had ideas of what we might do with college students to support their faith, but few of us could point to vibrant campuses where it was happening. I know now that we could have found many places where God is working in and through college ministries, but like most good ministry, itâs not easily replicable in other contexts. Ministry with college students calls us to carefully examine each college ministry context aware of the existing faith communities in the area, the ministry already happening on campus, and of course, the students themselves.
