Cool open-source film archiving tool This is a pretty sweet project if you’re an archivist trying to figure out how to digitize a large library of films. Â  I can still remember opening the print of The Discrete Charm of the BourgeoisieÂ to pre-screen it for our graduate school film screening series and immediately noticing the vinegar smell. Â The color was all tinted pink and red, and it was unusable. Â I still haven’t seen that film. If this kind of technology, at this kind of cost ($3200 including the camera), had been available, perhaps we could have screened the digital version instead so at least more people could have seen it.
