 [image from Report on Characteristics of the Washington Negro Market; its product buying and brand preferences in 1945; Afro American Newspapers Baltimore, MD 1946.] One of the things I’ve been marveling over for the last few weeks is a series of research reports on the “Negro Market” Â that I’ve slowly collected from various archives.Â Â Although I know from other projects (and Mad Men) that market research into consumer behavior really became established business practice during the 1950s, I had no idea there were research projects that were looking so closely at African American families and consumption as early as 1945. When I say closely, I mean, down to the brand preference of toothpaste. Although the data is problematic because of the way in which segregation and racism could influence the availability of products, these documents are still an extraordinary find and the only source ofÂ  data on car ownership (which was my original purpose in looking for them) that I’ve been able to find for this period. Many of these reports were funded by black newspapers–the Afro American Newspaper GroupÂ (Washington,DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia), theÂ and the Pittsburgh Courier were the most active in this research–and were designed to make the case to both black and white businesses that the African American consumer was a powerful emerging market. For the newspapers, the research into the “Negro Market” argued forcefully that advertising dollars would be well spent in their pages. What’s fascinating to me about reading through these over the course of the 1950s is the degree to which consciousness about the power of consumption really changes in a very short period of time. In the early period, just after WWII, the market reports are clearly putting forth a new image of African Americans AS consumers, and this is some ways a project of describing a new kind of identity. But, by the late 50s, those same consumers nowÂ understand the political and the economic power of their dollar and have begun to wield it extremely effectively: asÂ a political tool, in the form of boycotts and sit-ins and as aÂ legal tool, by putting constant pressure on segregated public accommodations such as hotels to accept them as customers.Â  This builds on what Grace Hale, Robert Weems and Lizbeth Cohen have written about segregation and consumption to a degree, but I think there is story here as well about the way in which consumption allows people to claim segregated public space that is becoming increasingly unstable as the 50s draw to a close.
