The Journal of Interactive Media in Education (JIME) invites contributions for a Special Issue that expands on the trends explored in the successful ‘Bristol Ideas in Mobile Learning Symposium’ (seeÂ http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8540), which took place March 6-7, 2014. The Special Issue is due to be published in Spring 2015 and is open to Symposium participants and any interested researchers. Papers will be reviewed following the usual JIME pattern of a double blind review by two reviewers. Requested contributions should offer any combination of conceptual, critical, design, empirical, theoretical or experimental work that addresses at least one of the following three trends of mobile learning state-of-the-art research: New patterns of connected social learning and work-based practices Learning Design for ‘mobile learning’ at scale Exploring the new thresholds of learning enabled by mobile technologies. Examples of key questions in these research trends are provided below (but should not restrict contributions). We expect the Special Issue to contain up to 6 full length reviewed articles and there may also be capacity for two short ‘position’ papers. Deadline for the submission of papers: September 22ndÂ 2014. John Cook, Yishay Mor and Patricia Santos (as co-chairs of the Symposium) are the Guest Editors. Correspondence:Â john2.cook@uwe.ac.uk
