Three volumes of wills for historic Lincolnshire have now appeared on British History Online. Covering nearly three centuries, from 1272 until the reign of Henry VIII, they contain several hundred wills, transcribed in full. They were originally edited by Canon C.W. Foster for the Lincoln Record Society, between 1914 and 1930. They join existing holdings of wills, principally for London.
