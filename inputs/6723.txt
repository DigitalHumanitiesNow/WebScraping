So, I discovered that one of my pet peeves is when some self-involved colleague presumes to speak for meÂ and all &#8220;professors&#8221; while dishing out advice to students that is both hostile and counterproductive. Maybe we&#8217;d talk to our pet rocks like they&#8217;re not thinking, feeling adults. &#8220;Don&#8217;t move pet rock;&#8221; &#8220;don&#8217;t engage me unless you&#8217;re [&#8230;]
