This paper will discuss the history of public epigraphic databases, including the Packard Greek Inscriptions database, the Epigraphische Datenbank Heidelberg and Epigraphik-Datenbank Clauss-Slaby, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches to online collections, especially with reference to scale, usability, technical standards, openness and transparency, collaboration and discoverability through metadata. Some consideration of user reactions to these databases will lead to the conclusion that the Digital Humanities perspectives discussed above do not reflect well the desires and apparent needs of normal epigraphic scholars. Does this disjunction of priorities suggest that we should reconsider the aims of electronic publication, or attempt to educate academics as to the importance of standards and metadata? The paper will close with a suggestion for an approach drawing from the papyrological community that might combine these two facets, building scale without sacrificing quality, and harnessing the epigraphic scholarly community to build a more powerful and interoperable epigraphic corpus.
