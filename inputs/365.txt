A part of Stanfordâs Spatial History Project, the Holocaust Geographies Collaborative aims to illustrate how geography can further scholarsâ understanding of the Holocaust.In a subset of the project, âBuilding the New Order: 1938-1945,â researchers constructed the first iterative map of the borders of European states during these volatile years. A sliding scale on the bottom of the map allows the user to choose any point or period in those seven years and see the shifts in borders and territorial claims, along with an option to overlay Allied advances. The map illustrates the importance of second fronts and the superiority of a non-contiguous second front, first showing Germany expanding its authority eastward and westward, and then the Allies advancing from the east, south, and then West to close on Berlin in 1945.Another subset of the project, âThe Evolution of the SS Concentration Camp System, 1933-1945,â shows with a similar sliding scale at the bottom of the map where SS camps sprung up, and is overlaid with an option to include the shifting borders and Allied advances from âBuilding a New Orderâ to see how the development of camps correlated with changes in territorial control. The map illustrates an interesting pattern for possible further examination: The Nazis expanded their patchwork of camps only towards the Soviet Union, rather than towards occupied France or Axis ally Italy. The result of this is made evident when the map is configured to show advancing Allied (Soviet) forces wipe camps from the map as they moved towards Berlin. The map could thus open up a question for scholars as to whether the Germans tried to open camp systems in alternate directions, and if not, why not?Both of these maps make clear the projectâs emphasis on âdistant reading,â which Gregory and Cooper define as summarizing a large body of textual information (in this case in a map format) without having to actually read it. This distance is affirmed by the fact that on neither map can the user click on a camp name or border change and read anything more than the name of the camp or the country the border changed in. (As such, these maps would be more useful to someone who already knew enough about the war and the camps to contextualize the patterns the maps illuminate.)The possibility of a future iterations of âThe Evolution of the SS Concentration Camp System, 1933-1945â including the ability to click on a camp name for a multimedia description of the camp derived from the apparently disparate data sources Gregory and Cooper point out GIS is uniquely positioned to use gave me pause while reading a section of Bodenhamerâs article.Bodenhamer says such âvirtual reconstructionâ as would be a logical technological end-point of such descriptions, would be able to ââ¦engage four primary senses, making the experience even more real for participants.â Bodenhamerâs examples of these kinds of virtual worlds include the Collesium, colonial Jamestown, and 19th-century Morgantown.These are obviously very different environments from a concentration camps. When attempting to re-create a place like a concentration camp, Bodenhamerâs enthusiasm made me wonder what responsibility the constructor of that virtual world has to warn a user that that world might be deeply upsetting? And is it wise to attempt full, immersive reconstruction of an environment that was defined by the existential danger its inhabitants were in, rather than its sights, sounds, and smells?There would be a real danger in stressing too much the likeness of such a virtual world to that upon which it is modeled. Users might feel repulsed by what they âexperienceâ but would never be able to feel the fear of an actual inhabitant of the camp â a point that should be kept foregrounded as such technology evolves as to create increasingly sophisticated virtual reconstructions.
