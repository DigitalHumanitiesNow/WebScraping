HTML Review During our last session, we covered basic HTML by building a very simple website. During our session today, we will continue that work using CSS. For those of you who missed our March 7 session, you may download the HTML. HTML/CSS Resources For those of you who are unfamiliar with HTML and CSS, I highly recommend working through, or at least scanning, the Opera Web Development Curriculum. The exercises are, for the most part, well written and easy to follow and use. I have added specific Opera:Dev articles that you should pay particular attention to in a separate post: Opera Dev: HTML and CSS. For those of you looking for a quick list of basic HTML elements, I recommend Dave Sheaâs MezzoBlue HTML Markup Guide. Working with WordPress WordPress is, at some level, the DH standard for building websites either for personal use or for other web based projects. It is such because of its, generally, user-friendly setup and because of its large and robust user base that offers access to numerous tutorials, exercises, and articles about using and working with WordPress in addition to the numerous plugins independently developed to increase WordPressâs functionality. Most web projects can be easily built using WordPress and plugins without ever touching a line of code, but sometimes we need/want to directly work directly with the WordPress code to add some further functionality or to simply learn about coding. We will begin our exploration of hacking WordPress by examining: Anatomy of a WordPress Theme as well as exploring the documentation available in the WordPress Codex to help users work with, modify, and develop websites built using WordPress.
