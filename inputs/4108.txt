IHR Digital has been funded by JISC to investigate the use of digital resources in Higher Education teaching and research. We are going to adopt a twin approach, looking at the use of digital resources generally and also concentrating specifically on British History Online. We are therefore asking anyone who uses, or has used, British History Online if they would be kind enough to take a short survey about their experience, and to tell us how we could improve. Thank you. Those interested in the project can find out more from our project page here.
