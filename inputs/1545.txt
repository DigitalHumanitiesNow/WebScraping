 I will present a talk Â at the 2014 SQL PASS Business Analytics Conference in San Jose on May 8th. The talk will focus on free and open tools for creating network maps and reports that can illuminate the landscape of social media.  The graph represents a network of 633 Twitter users whose tweets in the requested date range contained “sqlpass”, or who were replied to or mentioned in those tweets.Â The tweets in the network were tweeted over the 15-day, 2-hour, 48-minute period from Tuesday, 25 February 2014 at 00:26 UTC to Wednesday, 12 March 2014 at 03:15 UTC. There is an edge for each “replies-to” relationship in a tweet, an edge for each “mentions” relationship in a tweet, and a self-loop edge for each tweet that is not a “replies-to” or “mentions”. The graph’s vertices were grouped by cluster using the Clauset-Newman-Moore cluster algorithm. Â The graph was laid out using the Harel-Koren Fast Multiscale layout algorithm. The edge colors are based on edge weight values. The edge widths are based on edge weight values. The edge opacities are based on edge weight values. The vertex sizes are based on followers values. The vertex opacities are based on followers values.
