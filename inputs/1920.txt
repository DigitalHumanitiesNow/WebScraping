Back in 2003, at the Digital Humanities conference in Athens, Georgia, Geoffrey Rockwell and I threw all caution to the wind and performed a live Brechto-Socratic dialogue on the relationship between programming and writing.  People still ask us about it, but weâve never been sure exactly what to do with it.  The intellectual glow of THATcamp must have put me in the mood, because this afternoon it came to me â the ideal forum for what Geoffrey and I privately refer to as âUntitled #4â.  It was impossible to give Geoffreyâs character his signature beard, but other than that, I would say it perfectly recreates the original performance (including our extraordinary range as âvoice talentsâ).
