Despite the infrequency of posting this month, I am around, and plan to host the next History Carnival on May 1. Send nominations to jeremy AT clioweb DOT org (using "Carnival Nomination" or some derivative thereof in the subject line), or use the blog carnival submission form. (I promise to have my WordPress theme working and stop using the Kubric theme by then as well.)
