 I’ve been working through alot of revelatory material on African American consumer behavior in the 1950s but I’m not quite ready to share it yet, so instead I thought I’d post some of the odds and ends I’ve come across in theÂ  Warshaw Collection (about which I’ve written earlier) at the NMAH Archives Center. This is a broadside for a “Poverty Social” to be held on April 6, 1898–almost exactly 114 years ago. There was no other identifying material in the folder, which was entitled, “Amusements,” which I suppose is a pretty subjective description in this case.Â  I hope you can see the image well enough to read the text. I particularly like the little tally at the end where they assigned fines to items ofÂ  fine dress that violate the “poverty” dress code–because they also included “flirtin and spoonin,” which seems to me to beÂ a different sort of problem.Â Â It’s pretty stunning and even funny in a way, not the least because it actually appears to be a benefit of some kind…for the poor?Â  My first thought when I saw this, and absorbedÂ the contempt for the empovrished that it reflects, was how very contemporary it seemed.
