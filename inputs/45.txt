I posted an early draft of a module proposal last month, and I wanted to offer this update which is hopefully a lot cleaner and simpler to scan and get a sense of.  Below the module itself is my reasoning for why I think this is a great time for such a module to appear in the UK.I'm currently writing up my PhD and at the moment this is a course without a home; if you know of any institution which you think might be interested in such a module then please let me know.  Also if you have any questions or recommendations for changes then I'd love to hear from you._m         MODULE TITLE Digital English: How Technology is Changing What We Study PRE-REQUISITES None (no computer skills needed) AIMS This module aims to allow students to identify and interrogate the possibilities, and potential threats, digital technology offers to the study of English, and more generally to the practice of reading in the 21st century. In an age increasingly dominated by computers and the internet this course will allow students to engage with the arguments that are going on all around them. How might technology change the way we read texts? What new texts might be created? Is technology really a threat to reading? What makes reading from a screen different to reading a book? How does literary theory need to change in order to    consider electronic texts, and can these digital objects make theory easier to approach? These are the conversations going on    around the world as written texts become ever more diverse, and ever more accessible. As English scholars we have a unique    education in the impact of writing on readers, and this module aims to be part of putting us to work on the texts of our time.The module begins with a consideration of the 'threat' of technology, particularly the popular discourses of screen reading and easily accessible material attenuating focus and attention. From there we will go on to situate the current technologies historically, consider the unique details of their forms and their potential impacts on readers, and then move on to how we might respond, how we can theorise, and how we can productively use these new tools.As it encourages an advanced understanding of the increasing impact of digital technologies in the world, the course should prove particularly valuable to students who wish to pursue a career that might involve electronic modes of communication, digital content production, or further study of these issues.We will look at a diverse range of experimental and canonical texts, from novels to poems to theoretical, philosophical, and even neuropsychological work in order to understand what might be different about digital. This diversity has two functions: i) to demonstrate the range of aspects of English study that digitisation affects (and what new aspects it necessarily calls into play) and ii) to allow students to focus on what interests them most about English as a subject, whether that be close reading, high theory, or trying to understand the changing pleasures of the written word in all its forms. INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES (ILOs) Module Specific Skills - On successful completion of this module, students should be able to:a. demonstrate an advanced understanding of the current and potential implications of various digital technologies on English Studies.b. demonstrate an advanced ability to discuss what might make reading on screen different to reading from a printed page and the implications for readers.c. demonstrate an advanced understanding of how written electronic texts are situated in a history of technologies of textual reproduction. INDICATIVE SYLLABUS PLAN 1. The dangers of digital - What does technology do to reading?2. Scrolls to screens - how do electronic texts fit into the history of reading technologies?3. What does electronic literature look like (and how do we read it)? (offscreen)4. What does electronic literature look like (and how do we read it)? (onscreen)5. âIt doesn't feel rightâ - Neuropsychology and understanding what it means to hold a book.6. E-reader anatomy - features of digital reading devices and their impacts on reading and research.7. Digital subjectivities and electronic communities.8. Amateur vs. expert - authority online.9. Theory for electronic texts.10. What comes next?11. Summary, conclusions, and essay workshop. INDICATIVE READING LIST This reading list is intended to indicate the sort of work with which the module is concerned; it is by no means comprehensive. Ideally a reading pack would be produced with a mixture of complete essays and extracts from longer works.Espen Aarseth. Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature.

(is there an undergrad option?) / Do they have undergrad English modules which include the impact of digitisation?):Oxford (Yes - Oxford e-Research Centre (no undergrad) & Oxford Internet Institute (limited undergrad lecture series) / No)UCL (Yes - Centre for the Digital Humanities (no undergrad) / No)Cambridge (Yes - CRASSH Digital Humanities (no undergrad) / No)St Andrews (No / No)Warwick (No / No)Buckingham (No / No)Durham (No / No)Exeter (No (CMIT Digital Arts & Humanities discontinued as of this year) / No)Edinburgh (No / No)King's College London (Yes - Centre for Computing in the Humanities (with undergrad course) / No)York (No / No)Aberdeen (Yes - Recoded at the Centre for Modern Thought (no undergrad) / No)Queen Mary (No / No)Leeds (No / No)Liverpool (No / No)Glasgow (Yes - Humanities Advanced Technology and Information Institute (with undergrad course) / No)Essex (No / No)UEA (No / No)Bristol (No / No)Brunel (No / No)The vast majority of undergraduate English students who make it into a top 20 university (for their subject) will have no immediate access to academic discussion of how computers, the internet, digital reading devices, and the issues provoked by their use apply to their chosen field.  In a time which is fast becoming defined by on- and off-line digital activities this seems to represent a failure to keep up with current developments in issues which will become increasingly relevant to society and scholarship, and also marks a space where universities outside of this ranking can very easily become competitive by demonstrating their sensitivity to the times, and to the needs and desires of their students. It is, perhaps, too easy to assume that English students, by choosing their courses over, say, Computer Science, have made their decision to exclude themselves from such debates.  The rise of postgraduate courses in the Digital Humanities at UCL and Kings, and the HATII undergrad course at Glasgow, not to mention the currently promoted AHRC theme of 'Digital Transformations' and the rise of the Digital Humanities as a significant international academic discourse, demonstrates that there are an increasing number of voices from the Humanities which wish to make themselves heard in this area. Those few courses that are available, however, have a strong programming / production / Computer Science element, where radically unfamiliar skills must be acquired in order to take part, and a commitment to specialisation must be made early on.  There is clearly a space for students who are interested in the impact of digitisation on Humanities study, but don't yet want to specialise, and also for those who want to interpret digital content without having to go about learning to code and produce such materials for themselves. The present situation is comparable to having Creative Writing as the sole approach to studying literature; practice, however significant and informative, is not the only way to encounter a subject. This is certainly not to talk down the importance of Humanities researchers learning to code and markup text, indeed these skills are increasingly vital, but they involve a certain kind of specialised tuition and requirement of resources which is perhaps not yet available, or in many cases desirable, atundergrad level. I would like to propose a course that could be taught as a 2nd or 3rd year optional module which would seek to fill the gap between an English course unable to talk about digital technology, and one which is so specialised as to be off-putting or impractical. By focussing on the interpretation of digital materials and the impact of digitisation on English Studies I believe that it could be made non-threatening, and indeed actively appealing to undergraduate students seeking to expand their skills as they turn an eye to the job market beyond HE study.  A graduate who is easily able to demonstrate how their degree might be a good fit for certain jobs, in sectors which might not otherwise have realised the value in their input, has to be more competitive as they enter the fray.  With the contemporary literature and theory elements I would like to include it would also be a particularly appealing module for those students interested in contemporary experimental literature and the evolution of English Studies as a whole.
