In episode 71 we are joined by John Jasso, Assistant Professor of English at Penn State. After receiving a B.A. and then an M.A. degree in Communication Studies at Kansas State University, John graduated with a PhD in communication from the University of Pittsburgh.  He is the author of âMerging Pedagogies and Converging Media: Classical Meets Critical in the Digital Age,â Explorations in Media Ecology 12.1&2 (2013): 121â134. Our conversation focuses on what Jasso calls Platoâs Psychagogic Rhetoric, a phrase that suggests the manner in which Plato deployed (or had Socrates deploy) rhetorical strategies designed to move souls. It is a formulation that frames his dissertation âPsychagogia: A Study in the Platonic Tradition of Rhetoric from Antiquity through the Middle Ages.â Our discussion extends from Homer to St. Bonaventure, but we focus in some detail on Plato’s Republic and Phaedrus.
