We are organising a “Mobile Learning Festival” (MobilLearnFest) as part of the “Ideas in Mobile Learning Symposium” (6th – 7th March 2014, Watershed, Bristol UK; submission deadline: January 5th 2014). The MobiLearnFest will be an experimental, interactive, hands-on, open session which aims to give participants an opportunity to experience the ideas discussed at the Symposium and engage the general public in our conversation:Â http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8507  If you’re considering a submission for the MobiLearnFest, you might have a demo or activity already planned – which is fine, or you might want to offer a mobile learning experience which related to the local environment. In this case, we have prepared a resource cloud to help you prepare your submission:Â http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8519  Parts of this cloud are open for crowdsourcing (an editable map, a wiki, a social bookmarking site), so if you happen to have any relevant knowledge – we would appreciate your contribution!
