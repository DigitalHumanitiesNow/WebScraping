It is 23Â°F and SEK is rollingÂ home from the storeÂ with a car full of cat litter and sushi when he spots hisÂ HAT-HATING NEMESISÂ wearing a hat while taking out the trash.  SEK:Â (to himself) The worm has turned!  SEK slows the car down as he approaches his HAT-HATING NEMESIS.  SEK:Â (to himself) This is gonna be great â Iâm gonna nail his hat-hating ass for wearing a hat in the middle of winter. Iâm gonna be even more Internet-famous now!  HAT-HATING NEMESIS looks at SEK as he performs a patented âPrairieville driftâ into 20 mph terrority.  SEK:Â (to himself) Time to roll down the window and give that fucking hypocrite what he deserves.  HAT-HATING NEMESIS raises his arm andÂ politely waves at SEK. SEK prepares to roll down the window and give him the olâ what-for whenâ¦  SEKâS CAR STEREO:Â âShouldnât I have all of this â shouldnât I have this â shouldnât I have all of this and âÂ passionate kisses!â SEK:Â (VERY ALOUD) FOR FUCKâS SAKE!  SEK hits the gas and speeds off in shame.
