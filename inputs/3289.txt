 @johnmjones Goah, wasn't that awful. Dick Clark's voice will give me nightmares for years to come. # RT @JenHoward: Some thoughts on the story/stories of #mla09. Some of you are mentioned. Happy New Year, all! http://u.nu/88ge4 # Getting kids into bed and then to prep for friends coming over. # @ChrisKubica Thanks. I was worried about the initials, but I didn't have time at the moment to check myself. Kudos. in reply to ChrisKubica # @JenHoward More to the point, the only women are at numbers 39 and 40. At the bottom. in reply to JenHoward # @academicdave The 3rd party control is why @spikenlilli advocated building our own system way back at the #MLA140 panel at #MLA08. in reply to academicdave # Disheartened by how little time I've had to read most end-of-year #music lists thus far. # @sterflu Step 1:Fix Twitter's ephemerality. Step 2: Get over yourself? in reply to sterflu # @nowviskie Good point. I don't see @jerrymcgann doing much here yet. in reply to nowviskie # @foundhistory Do you mean that we'd marginalize older DH scholars on listservs? Or the wider body of the profession? in reply to foundhistory # @foundhistory This won't be it in reply to foundhistory # I agree with @academicdave: Twitter isn't a backchannel anymore. it's the primary means for communication for DHers and related folks. in reply to academicdave # @ryancordell Great news! Glad things are moving along for you and some other friends. in reply to ryancordell # @captwhiffle Thanks. It strangely got picked up by the @chronicle too. Weird week. # Great post by @amandafrench on the need to amplify and speed up scholarly communication at #MLA09 and everywhere else: http://bit.ly/7SRgqZ. # @samplereality Tell it man, tell it! (I'm partial to turkey "bacon" myself.) in reply to samplereality # Spending some quality time with Black Moth Super Rainbow (#music) as I clear a suddenly very full inbox. No #jobmarket offers yet. # The #MLA09 / @chronicle / @bitchphd / Twitter jump in my blog stats: http://bit.ly/5M33rX. # @kfitz @samplereality So is DH just something that we know when we see it? Or when we mean it? in reply to kfitz # @samplereality It does seem that DH *does* rely on tools; tools in addition to those the rest of the profession uses. # @kfitz Insofar as DH tends to be about collaboration rather than single scholarly production, and social media goes in the same direction. in reply to kfitz # And with the fading of #MLA09, I can leave Tweetdeck and go back to the comforting simplicity of Twhirl. # @kfitz Yes, I think you're right. But is digital communication the same thing as DH? #MLA09 & #MLA08 proves Twitter matters. Not sure re: DH in reply to kfitz # @kfitz @mkirschenbaum I'm still wondering, howver, if it was just that DH broke b/c it was visible via Twitter in a way other panels werent in reply to kfitz # @jcmeloni Happy birthday!! in reply to jcmeloni # @mkirschenbaum Only good news to relate in a generally dismal environment? in reply to mkirschenbaum # Wondering why there weren't more #MLA09 tips during the actual convention? Sad to say things aren't as funny when you're actually there. # .@mkirschenbaum et al After all, it's much harder to get attention 4 panel tht stays inside room @ #MLA09. Twitter did most the work. [2/2] # .@mkirschenbaum @nowviskie @kfitz @amandafrench The fact that @chronicle covered it should spur more to use social media [1/2]. # .@mkirschenbaum After all, attention is the coin of the realm, and it's easy to share attention online. And that shift is part of DH. # .@mkirschenbaum I agree with @nowviskie that it shows the generosity of a group of scholars. Or how easy it *is* to be generous online. # @nowviskie Pick me! Pick me! There's pumpkin bread in it for you! # @chellebelle13 Thanks so much. I loved the class too. Teaching it again this semester, but I don't know of it will be able to compare. # And now my #MLA09 paper has been picked up by @bitchphd: http://bit.ly/4EuIz5. # @theyellowedpage Thanks very much. I don't know how else to describe higher ed's labor situation other than "sad." # @jcmeloni Knock 'em dead! # Trying to explain @chronicle to my in-laws, I've settled on saying it's the academics' *Daily Prophet*. # While I was building Legos this morning (in Georgia not Philly), the @Chronicle picked up my #MLA09 paper: http://bit.ly/8ez27z. Wow. # @academicdave I was really intrigued to go and meet him as well (and to ask for a job). Glad you got the chance for the former. in reply to academicdave # @ktcrow Strange things, huh? Thanks though! in reply to ktcrow # RT @academicdave: Only at the #mla09 : reading one's  iPhone with the help of a monacle. # Thank you all for the kind comments on the "Absent Present" paper. Ironically, it was probably heard better by my not being at #MLA09. # @mkirschenbaum Congrats again on the very well-deserved award you're collecting. #MLA09 # @coryb Attendance. Read It Later. And Remote. # @NewFacMajority Glad that you saw it. And I'm glad that subjects like this are getting more and more play at #MLA09. # @amandafrench I <3 me some lmgtfy. in reply to amandafrench # @amandafrench The interest on these goes on hold for 3 years. And then it accrues with IBR. (Oh, so you've *heard* of Google?  ) in reply to amandafrench # @wpwend42 Check out http://bit.ly/8Fgs49. in reply to wpwend42 # @amandafrench http://bit.ly/8Fgs49 Lowered my monthly payment from $400 to $0. It took just a few weeks to process. in reply to amandafrench # @amandafrench Thanks much. The loans are on hold thanks to new IBR program that started this year. Thankfully. # .@joguldi I still *do* qualify for food stamps. I'm just above the poverty line, whatever that means.   #MLA09 # My #MLA09 panel is happening right now. I'm publishing my talk in absentia on "The Absent Presence: Today's Faculty": http://bit.ly/5qdX9H. # @captain_primate Dont miss @samplereality's blog post about how he grades blogs. # @ryancordell Best of luck! # .@academicdave re: living dead, are you talking about the people, about the academic monograph, or about the book itself? #MLA09 # RT @kfitz: RT @mlatweetup: #mla09 tweetup 5pm Monk's 16th & Spruce # @nowviskie What about those rude attendees twittering?   #MLA09 # @samplereality I've always found those threads almost impossible to navigate effectively. # .@kfitz What we need is platform for new forms to become so dominant tht reading new texts on them=inevitable. Comp obv not there yet #MLA09 # .@academicdave @amandafrench There won't be Nobel for videogames. Not one for film. Can't look to old means of recog. for new forms. # @kfitz There is no try. Do or do not do. (Srsly: appreciate your efforts to keep us in loop) in reply to kfitz # @academicdave It means economic crisis has been hitting @mlaconventin hard too. No more free rides or free talks! in reply to academicdave # RT @MLAdeconvention: #mla09 Program scheduler  looks suspiciously like a dance card. Confirming once again that MLA = Prom. # @coryb I liked the messenger bag for several years, but it's started to kill my back. Being cool/stylish isn't worth that. in reply to coryb # Powered by Twitter Tools
