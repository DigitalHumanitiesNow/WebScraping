Since my first Digital History class in 2008, I've been telling students that I wanted them to be "uncomfortable, but not paralyzed" based on my sense that it was only when one struggled a bit that deep  learning occurred.  The concept has explicitly shaped much of my teaching since then.  Now the Mindshift blog at KQED is reporting that there are several studies that back up my reasoning.In one study, published in Learning and Instruction, psychologists Sidney D'Mello and Art Graesser found "that even negative emotions can play a productive role in learning."Confusion, DâMello explains, is a state of âcognitive disequilbriumâ; we are mentally thrown off balance when we encounter information that doesnât make sense. This uneasy feeling motivates us to restore our equilibrium through thought, reflection, and problem solving, and deeper learning is the result. According to DâMello, engaged learners repeatedly experience âtwo-step episodesalternating between confusion and insight.â Back and forth, between perplexity and understanding: this is how the learning of complex material happens.In fact, deep learning may be unlikely to happen without the experience of confusion, suggests a study conducted by another researcher, Arizona Stateâs Kurt VanLehn. The students in his experiment were not able to grasp the physics concepts they were learning until they had encountered, and surmounted, an intellectual âimpasse.âStill another study, this one led by Harvard physicist Eric Mazur, found that students who observed a demonstration in science class understood the relevant concept no better than beforeâunless the students were asked to predict the outcome of the demonstration in advance. When their predictions turned out to be wrong, the resulting confusion motivated them to consider the concept more deeply, and they learned more.On a related note, Stephen Ramsey at the University of Nebraska has a wonderful post that eloquently makes the case that attitude is more important than (initial) aptitude in learning programming.Nearly every programmer I know â and I know some great ones â started out not with a course, or a book, or a teacher, but with a problem that was irritating them. Something in their computational world didnât seem right. Maybe it was broken, or maybe just missing. But being comfortable with not-knowing-what-the-hell-theyâre-doing, they decided that getting a computer to do something new was more-or-less like figuring out how to get the chain back on the bike. They werenât trying to âbe programmersâ any more than the parent determined to fix the kidâs bike is trying to be a âbicycle mechanic.âAll of these suggest that cultivating mental habits among our students (and ourselves) where we are okay with being unfamiliar with a subject, okay with struggling to master a concept or tool or problem, okay with working in new formats, okay with failure and trying again is important for intellectual and academic development in school and with the work done outside of school.
