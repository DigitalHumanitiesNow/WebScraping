For our last lunch in LA, we go find the Korean Taco Truck. It’s delicious and not the kind of thing you’d find anywhere else.  While we’re eating the Quizno’s across the street calls the police, who come and chase them away.  Then some enraged lady accosts us ranting about how “we have rights as consumers” to a superior product (Korean tacos > Quizno’s subs) and we need to organize and start a movement in the city.  Meanwhile, I’m sure someone in the truck has already tweeted their new location as they are driving away. That’s right, a people’s uprising for Korean tacos.  From a truck.
