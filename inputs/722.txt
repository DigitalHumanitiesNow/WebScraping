There is nothing more fun to teach than Platoâ€™s dialogues. Whether they love him or hate him, the figure of Socrates Plato draws in his dialogues move students to think more deeply about their relationships with one another and the world they inhabit. With my new book, Socratic and Platonic Political Philosophy, I am trying to provide faculty with a platform that empowers students of the dialogues to engage with one another in public discussion of the Protagoras, Gorgias, Phaedo, Apology, and Phaedrus.  Here is a description of the book and the digital platform:  If your library has a digital copy of the book, students should be able to access the enhanced digital book and add private notes and public comments that are fed to this blog where I and others can engage with them. So, if you plan to teach the Protagoras, Gorgias, Phaedo, Apology, or Phaedrus this semester, I invite you and your students to take a look at the relevant chapter and join the conversation online.  I will be happy to respond online or to Skype or G+ Hangout with your class.
