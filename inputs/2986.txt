prostheticknowledge:Storytelling through playful interactionsInstallation by agency Dalziel + Pow demonstrates how experiences with interaction and projection can work well with screenprinted illustrations made with conductive ink:As part of our presence at the inaugural Retail Design Expo, we have created a space to stand out from the crowd, a conversation starter: experimental, innovative, playful, integrated, exploratory and, to many visitors, surprising.Â â¦ Screen-printed illustrations spring to life when touched, as conductive ink triggers a host of playful digital animations â a mix of informative and charming content, from product information to brand stories to chasing ducks. Pushing the boundaries of storytelling within a space, making it fun and engaging, putting ideas before hardware. A total of 48 interactions and over 100 unique animations make up the broad spectrum of content on the stand, from simple sound toys to more  complex exchanges that layer projection mapping and movement around a  physical space.
