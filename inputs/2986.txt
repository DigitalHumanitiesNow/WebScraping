The Pelagios project is pleased to announce a two-day colloquium on the subject of âLinked Pastsâ, 20-21 July 2015, at KCL (The Great Hall, The Strand Campus). Bringing together leading exponents of Linked Data from across the Humanities and Cultural Heritage sector, we address some of the challenges to developing a digital ecosystem of online open materials, through two days of position papers, discussion and breakout group activity. Day 1 will tackle the themes of Time, Geo and People, and issues of Open Data, Classification Schemes and Infrastructure. Day 2 will be devoted to two parallel structured activities, one exploring Niches (space, time, people), and the other Nutrition Cycles (open data, classification, infrastructure). For details of the line up of talks and contributors, see below.Refreshments (tea/coffee, lunch) will be provided, along with a reception on Monday evening.The event is free of charge but places are limited.
