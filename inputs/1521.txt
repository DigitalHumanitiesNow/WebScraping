Smith, Director, Social Media Research Foundation Social media matters – it matters to consumers â and that social chatter can matter to you if you understood how to interpret it. Learn to identify your key social media influencers and use that information to amplify your brand’s message.Â  Uncover connections between sales and social media data, empower marketing to uncover new dining trends and brand champions, and even impact loss prevention efforts. This session will teach you how to apply social media network maps to your brand (and competitor’s). Restaurant executives, in particular those with a technology mind-set, will find great value in learning how to build, interpret and use social network maps. Participants will have an opportunity to map their own brand on social media using the free and open NodeXL (http://nodexl.codeplex.com) tool.
