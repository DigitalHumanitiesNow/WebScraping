This afternoon, the Ancient World Mapping Center is participating in The University of North Carolina‘s annual University Research Day. Â The Center will be displaying a poster collage of our latest research and programming, especially in regard to Antiquity A-la-carte 3.0. Â The poster features with special prominence an image of our forthcomingÂ Strabo OnlineÂ web application in connection with Duane Roller’s new translation of the GeographikaÂ for Cambridge University Press. Â It also displays images of A-la-carte’s capability to map man-made features according to the Pleiades database and the AWMC’s collection of shapefiles, to represent coastal variations both within periods of ancient history and in contrast to the modern topographical aspect, and to map surviving ancient features at tenths-of-a-second accuracy with the use of handheld GPS devices. Â  A PDF file of the poster (licensed under a Creative Commons CC BY License)Â can be seenÂ here.
