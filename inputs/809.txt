The exciting opportunities presented by video walls in public spaces also represent a range of challenges encompassing questions about engagement, staffing, planning and budgets. In this presentation from CNI’s spring 2015 meeting, Shawna Sadler (Deakin University), Mike Nutt (North Carolina State University) and Renee Reaume (University of Calgary) discuss the new roles and infrastructure needed for library installations of this type, and they describe some of the imaginative and interactive applications of this emerging resource. Managing Public Video Walls in an Academic Library is now available online:  and on YouTube: https://youtu.be/9mlLpkg6KEM To see all videos available from CNI, visit CNI’s video channels on YouTube (http://www.youtube.com/cnivideo) and Vimeo (http://vimeo.com/channels/cni).
