Ya gotta love web and graphic designers. Read a bunch of 'em arguing at Microsoft's Internet Explorer 7 developer's blog about the orange icon. To me, the argument against putting the letters "RSS" in a feed icon is wrong. It's condescending toward users and leads to using icons that fail to convey what the icon stands for.
