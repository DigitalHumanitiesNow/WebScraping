We’ve just released “More Like This,” a major upgrade to LibraryThing for Librariesâ “Similar items” recommendations. The upgrade is free and automatic for all current subscribers to LibraryThing for Libraries Catalog Enhancement Package. It adds several new categories of recommendations, as well as new features. We’ve got text about it below, but here’s a short (1:28) video:  What’s New Similar items now has a See more link, which opens More Like This. Browse through different types of recommendations, including: Similar items More by author Similar authors By readers Same series By tags By genre  You can also choose to show one or several of the new categories directly on the catalog page. Click a book in the lightbox to learn more about itâa summary when available, and a link to go directly to that item in the catalog.  Rate the usefulness of each recommended item right in your catalogâhovering over a cover gives you buttons that let you mark whether it’s a good or bad recommendation.  Try it Out!
