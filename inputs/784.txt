So, I'm going to cheat a little. I finished Infinite Jest about a week ago. (I proudly announced it on twitter; surprisingly, I have not yet received any fruit baskets or congratulatory Hallmark cards.) Because of this I haven't really known what to write about the novel.  In what follows there are not any real spoilers--no specific info concerning characters plot, etc. But I do talk in a general way about my sense of the novel; later I'll post some of sort of reckoning of the ending. This, though, is a sort of Public Service Announcement for those still reading the novel.  But here are just a few words that may be of some use to folks who are reading the novel for the first time (as I was) but who are not finished yet.  Primarily, slow down. In my experience, the first two or three hundred pages are a lot of confused groping around. After that point the novel becomes increasingly engaging, leading to what, by the last two hundred pages feels like a mad dash (many on #infsum have reported an Entertainment-like compulsion to read the novel once you pass the half-way point). How are the various plots of the novel going to come together? Etc.  To what extent the novel's ending is satisfying is the sort of question that can't really be broached seriously here. After a week of reflection, I think I can finally say I am not disappointed by the ending.  There are whole number of things I now wish that I had paid more attention to. I'll refrain from naming any specifically for fear of spoilers (though honestly, the things I wish I'd paid more attention to now are not things related to anything that even could be termed a "spoiler").  . . .  So after re-reading this post a number of times I've redacted everything except these two pieces of advice, that are so general as to be almost useless. Bu, if nothing else, IJ suggests:  Slow Down: The end is coming! But there is no sense in rushing it. Reread earlier portions of the novel. This is probably a good piece of advice at any point reading this novel. But returning to the first half is genuinely illuminating.
