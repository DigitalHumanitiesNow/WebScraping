Forced Migration Online (FMO) is produced by Oxfordâs Refugee Studies Center, along with academic collaborators, and offers a number of digital databases of content concerned forced migration around the world. I introduced our class to this digital project in a pecha kucha presentation in class today.I took my audience through navigation of the siteâs various features, including a digital library of primarily âgreyâ literature, which is academic literature that has not been formally published. The site is committed to sharing only open-access materials, those which do not require institutional login, so that aid workers and policymakers might also be able to use the information to shape policy and for practical purposes beyond academic research. Because of this, the digital library does not contain most journal articles.The site also includes an email list, videos developed in collaboration with partners, podcasts (which I would have expanded beyond Oxford-based events), photography sets grouped around theme, and a photography directory. Expanding thumbnails of all photos takes users to their metadata.FMO also curated a number of guides on themes and regions, culling the most significant content on the website and outside of it. âExpert guidesâ on many of the same regions and themes are also included for unclear reasons â I would have combined these with the previous theme and regional guides.I might have improved user experience by clarifying instructions for search rather than burying the most helpful information (keyword subjects) on the cataloguing page, and by structuring the organization such that each piece of content was tagged and lived only within one vertical.FMO is likely more able to be independent than other sources focusing on Refugee Studies. Think tanks are often funded by foreign governments whose human rights practices preclude its fellows from full transparency on forced migration issues, and organizations like the UN have a fundraising incentive to emphasize their own role in refugee work. However, because it has not beholden itself to outside financial pressures, FMO is currently unfunded and not being updated.One of the pressures of being digital is the expectation that content will be updated, as it is fairly easy to do relative to a book or magazine. Much content is very out of date on FMO, from far before it stopped being funded, including guides to Algeria that make it sound like the country has just emerged from civil war and Burma that sound like Ayn Sang Suu Kyi is still under house arrest.A major benefit to being digital is the ease with which contributions of documents, photos, and other materials can be solicited and made â FMO does an excellent and clear job of explaining the criteria for accepting materials and the process by which people may do so.I find the most important benefit to being digital as opposed to paper-based is that FMO is accessible to people around the world who live far from libraries and other traditional information centers. In countries like Iraq, where many libraries are still in bombed-out tatters, or South Sudan, which has one library in the entire country, a digital repository is the only one many residents might have a chance of gaining access to. A 2010 survey showed that 5% of FMOâs users were current or former forced migrants themselves, and by virtue of being digital, FMO becomes for them as well as about them.
