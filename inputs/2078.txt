There’s a theme emerging here. I woke up this morning to find out I got a mention in the acknowledgements for Heather Warren-Crow’s book Girlhood and the Plastic Image . Heather was one of my colleagues at the Center for 21st Century Studies so I was lucky enough to hear a lot about this book as it was being formulated and written and, I must admit, I was in awe.  But whereas Kelli Fuery mentioned my purpleness, Heather has given me perhaps the ultimate of accolades…  So clearly, I’m looking for a My Little Pony, giant jewellery or absurd trouser mention in the next book one of my friend-colleague-mentors writes (hint hint). But let me tell you right now that Heather Warren-Crow is quite literally THE SMARTEST WOMAN I KNOW (in every sense of the word) so don’t miss out on this book (or on hanging out with her, you know, if you can)!    via Tumblr http://ift.tt/1pDvAPi
