We are happy to welcome Carol Li as an intern here this summer, doing user experience testing and design to help us evaluate and design ArcGIS Open Data.   Carol grew up in the southern part of China and graduated from Beijing Forestry University with a degree in Digital Media Arts.  She recently earned a Masters of Science in Computer Graphics Technology from Purdue University.   Carol is passionate about UX design, and likes to think about why people think one thing or another as they experience a software product, and how to influence their experience.   Since moving to the area for this internship, Carol has already played tour guide, taking friends around to various Washington DC sites.  She especially enjoyed experiencing the Fourth of July fireworks from the National Mall.   Aside from her professional interests (link: http://site363352.webydo.com) Carol loves hiking, badminton,  and swimming.  She also plays piano and practices the art of Chinese Caligraphy. Welcome Carol!
