Recently the National Endowment for the Humanities announced an unprecedented grant opportunity to fund family and local history. The Common Heritage grants call for widespread work to build community and capture history on the ground. The Omeka team shares these goals and is eager to support this work!  Consider using the Omeka system as your base of operations for collecting and describing the materials you plan to digitize. Widen your project’s reach by using the Contribution plugins to enable members of the public to upload and describe their born-digital materials. Finally, consider working with your community to narrate their history using the Exhibit Builder plugin. Don’t forget that you don’t have to have your own server space to use Omeka in your Common Heritage project. You can sign up for an Omeka.net subscription and leave the hosting, updating, and maintenance to us!
