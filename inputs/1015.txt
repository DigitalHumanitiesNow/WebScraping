Visualizing the Royal Society Archive, 1665-2005 -- Chris Harrison has created an interesting timeline of author word distribution in the published papers of the Royal Society's journal. Among other things, Harrison notes that paper titles have grown shorter over the past 340 years and there was a significant decrease in the number of papers published starting in 1761. The visualization of the timeline is nice,though the images available on the website are too small to read details. It certainly makes me want to try an HTML version, but that would prove very challenging.   *[HTML]: Hypertext Markup Language
