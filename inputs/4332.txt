Here’s the abstract I submitted for the talk:  Much of the discussion of digital humanities in libraries is directed to programmatic questions: who to hire for library-based digital humanities work, what skills might these people need, how best to house and equip new (or old) digital initiatives, what projects and partnerships to pursue. When discussions do turn to the mission or purpose of digital humanities in libraries, these debates often seem drained of the animated specificity devoted to administrative, programmatic questions. Redressing this imbalance in our professional attention as a library profession can strengthen our planning for, participation in, and leadership of digital humanities scholarship. This talk then is intended as one contribution toward the project of better articulating a theory that can shape and guide librariesâ digital humanities practice. By tracing librarianshipâs historical self-understanding and identifying points of connection between library theory and some of the major ideas of humanistic scholarship, it is possible to show how and why digital humanities research should be part of the core work of libraries.
