By Ann Sneesby-Koch  	We are very happy to present, at long last, the videos from theÂ 2014 Office of Digital Humanities Project Directors Meeting, which was held September 15, 2014 at the NEH's new home in the Constitution Center in Washington, DC. Â This meeting brought together the top researchers in the digital humanities from across the United States, who shared their projects in short, three-minute lightning round presentations. Â Enjoy these videos from project directors of NEH'sÂ Digital Humanities Implementation Grants.
