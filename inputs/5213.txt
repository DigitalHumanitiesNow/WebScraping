no wait, 'a giant step for me'... a massively underwhelming one for mankind: the Memory at War Project newsletter features a writeup I did on detecting Memory Events in Russian press coverage of the August Putch. If that sounds like your sort of thing, I understand you can read about it here, unabridged and all: http://www.memoryatwar.org/enewsletter-May-2013.pdfNot that I made the front-page. I'll tell myself it was only a beauty-contest, anyway!
