Christianity Today reports a forthcoming study by sociologist Philip Schwadel that there is a growing âintensity gapâ between Protestants and Catholics, âwith some 56 percent of evangelicals describing themselves as âstrongly affiliatedâ with their religion compared with 35 percent of Catholics.â At the First Things blog On the Square, James Rogers explains that the gap in enthusiasm could be growing because less-committed evangelicals are dropping their affiliation to evangelicalism altogether, a finding that fits with Pewâs October report that âin the last five years alone, the unaffiliated have increased from just over 15% to just under 20% of all U.S. adults.â
