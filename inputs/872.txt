 I will present a tutorial on social media network analysis at the 2014 International Conference on Social Computing, Behavioral-Cultural Modeling, & Prediction (SBP14) April 2 â April 4, 2014UCDC Center Washington DC, USA The 2014 International Conference on Social Computing, Behavioral-Cultural Modeling, and Prediction (SBP14) is a multidisciplinary conference with a single paper track and poster session. SBP invites a small number of high quality tutorials and nationally recognized keynote speakers. The SBP conference provides a forum for researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government agencies to exchange ideas on current challenges in social computing, behavioral modeling and prediction, and on state-of-the-art methods and best practices being adopted to tackle these challenges. Interactive events at the conference are designed to promote cross-disciplinary contact. Social Computing harnesses the power of computational methods to study social behavior within a social context. Behavioral Cultural modeling refers to representing behavior and culture in the abstract, and is a convenient and powerful way to conduct virtual experiments and scenario analysis. Both social computing and behavioral cultural modeling are techniques designed to achieve a better understanding of complex behaviors, patterns, and associated outcomes of interest. Moreover, these approaches are inherently interdisciplinary; subsystems and system components exist at multiple levels of analysis (i.e., “cells to societies”) and across multiple disciplines, from engineering and the computational sciences to the social and health sciences.
