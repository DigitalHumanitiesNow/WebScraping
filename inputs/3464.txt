Whom Likes Whom in the Middle-East? [informationisbeautiful.net] by David McCandless and UniversLab is a forced-network visualisation of key players & notable relationships in the Middle East.  Next to its expressive aesthetic, the interactive features allow users to highlight individual nodes and its direct connections to others, as well as filter between the kind of possible relationships, such as "hate", "strained", "good" or "love".  Reminds me a bit of Mapping the Relationships between the Artists who Invented Abstraction.
