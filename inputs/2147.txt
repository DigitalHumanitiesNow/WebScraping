I'm curious to know what software humanities scholars are using to wrangle large collections of images. I often encounter scholars who struggle to manage large image collections â it's not at all unusual to find people managing collections of historical images with iPhoto â and wondered if there are databases that make sense for visual collections. I'm especially interested in programs that: work out of the box and have a GUI (sorry) are designed for individuals, not enterprises allow a scholar to quickly apprehend many images at once allow one to add metadata (like place and date) â something beyond tags would be nice â and construct queries make sense for people who have a lot of digital surrogates of primary sources (which is to say, systems that are optimized to retrieve the EXIF data from a photo of an archival document won't make a whole lot of sense) I know about Picasa, LightRoom, and ImagePlot. I don't think an enterprise-level system like ContenDM or the like makes sense for individual scholars. Omeka, of course, is nice, but it's a bit unwieldy if you're just trying to manage a collection. What am I missing?
