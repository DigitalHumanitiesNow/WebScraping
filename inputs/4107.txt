British History Online (BHO) has been generously funded by the American Friends of the IHR  to digitise more of the Alumni Oxonienses, a listing of members of the University of Oxford compiled by Joseph Foster. Last year, also with funding from the American Friends, we began by digitising the first two volumes of the 1500-1714 series (the first of two). You can see the results published here. We are very pleased the American Friends have decided to give us this further funding, so that we can complete the digitisation of the 1500-1714 volumes. Fosterâ€™s painstaking work is rich in biographical detail and will be of interest to many British historians of the period, as well as family historians too.
