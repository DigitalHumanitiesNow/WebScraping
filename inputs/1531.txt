 RIS News, the leading media organization for retail executives, and Consumer Goods Technology, the leading source for the consumer goods sector, have partnered to launch theÂ 2014 Retail and Consumer Goods Analytics Summit. The conference hashtag isÂ #RCAS2014. I will speak on September 12th at theÂ event. Â I present theÂ Closing KeynoteÂ fromÂ 2:30 – 3:10pm on Friday. Â My talk is titled: The Impact of Social Media on Data & AnalyticsÂ  Speaker: Â Marc Smith, Director, Social Media Research Foundation People talk about the products and services the use, love or hate all the time in social media. Â These conversations can be better understood through perspective of social network analysis. Â Network theory views the world as a web of connected people. Â Network analysis builds measures and visualizations of collections of connections to reveal the key people, groups and issues in these conversations. Â Using social media network maps and reports the confusing landscape of tweets and posts comes into focus. Â Information visualizations of the virtual crowds of people gathered around every brand, product, event, or service highlights the range of variation in the shape of these crowds. Â Six different patterns have been identified so far, allowing social media managers to recognize the nature of the brand networkÂ they have and the nature of the network they want to have. Â Network measures are useful as KPIs for tracking not just the size and volume of a social media stream, but also the shape and structure of the pattern of connections. Â The six patterns: divided, unified, fragmented, clustered, and in and out hub and spoke, are a useful guide to strategic engagement in social media.
