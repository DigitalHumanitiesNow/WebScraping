 I was flattered when Rob Nelson of the University of Richmond’s Digital Scholarship Lab asked me to participate in a NITLE Webinar Event talking about Teaching DH 101. I’ll be joined this afternoon with my good friends (and fellow ProfHackers) Jeff McClurken and Ryan Cordell. We’ll each be speaking for about 10 minutes and then taking questions from the audience. I’ll be talking about my just concluded “Introduction to Digital Humanities” course and these are some of the links that I’ll be sharing or referring to as I speak. EDITED: The recording of the seminar is now available for viewing.
