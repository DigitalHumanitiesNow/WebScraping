The British Museum are producing a digital edition of Malcolm Mosher's work on the Book of the Dead, within which spells are presented in aggregated translations according to a number of traditions, presented alongside representative original vignettes. Papyri and linens that carry the spells and vignettes are distributed between different international institutions, but are associated with a much wider body of material culture that help to provide context for the spells. In our work the FRBRoo ontology is used to formalise the relationship between different works and manifestations, and interlinked with object descriptions in the CIDOC-CRM ontology.
