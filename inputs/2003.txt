This presentation will develop themes from current research in the area of Open Education and more specifically Open Educational Resources (OER). To encourage open educational practices requires much more than technological changes; it requires an understanding of the challenges facing the educational community today and how OERs can help them achieve their goals particularly in research led teaching and learning. These ideas will be located within the sphere of teaching and research in Classics drawing on the experiences of the Digital Classicist and other open initiatives in Classical Studies.
