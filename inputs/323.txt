A piece in the New York Times this morning explored how software can now replicate an array of human voices to report on topics likeÂ sports and economics. While these data-rich and data-reliantÂ subjects seem well-suited for algorithmic production, a passage jumped out that seemed incongruous with these conditions:“Kristian Hammond, Narrative Scienceâs co-founder, estimatesÂ that 90 percent of news could be algorithmically generated by the mid-2020s, much of it without human intervention. If this projection is anywhere near accurate, weâre on a slippery slope.”90% should be a percentageÂ that concerns anyone who makes a living writing for a news outlet. But what Hammond doesn’t say, and the article’s authorÂ doesn’t clarify, is that most news organizationsÂ (other thanÂ wires like the AP and Bloomberg terminals) aren’t in the business of reporting or even analyzing reporting so much as they are in contextualizing and opining on isolated incidents. Most news is not economic forecasts and earnings calls, and most sports writing, unlike sports management, isn’t Moneyball.Figures like 90% raise some of the same alarmist hackles that are often raised when the narrative of “gloomy bibliophiles and triumphant technophiles,” as Paul Duguid put it in last week’s reading, is invoked. Had I edited Podolny’s piece, I would have asked her to evaluate Hammond’s claims more rigorously – an editorial judgement call technology, incidentally, isn’t interested in making, at least within the confines of this article.
