The research sites on the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s that my US Women's History students haveÂ created as part of our project to re-create the Mary Washington college classroom experience are now up on the course site.Please check the sites out, and vote for the site that you think provides the best set of resources for our class to actually re-create the classroom experience.Thanks!
