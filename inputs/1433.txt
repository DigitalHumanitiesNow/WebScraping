My brother Justin and his buddy Justin Collins visited me this weekend. We decided to ramble around DC on Saturday.    Here's a picture of my brother (left) and Collins (right) outside a nice pizzaria where we got lunch.    Collins apparently had a long day that Saturday, so he was asleep about 10 minutes into the trip back to my apartment.
