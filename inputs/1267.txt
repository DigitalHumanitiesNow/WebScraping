      Between the 30rd of August and the 1st of September, the IFPH-FIHP (International Federation for Public History) will sponsor a Public History Conference in Greece. This Greek Public history symposium could become starting 2014-2015, a regular International Public History Summer School sponsored by the IFPH-FIHP.  The conference is entitled Use and Abuse of History: the Public History in Greece and is organized by the University of Macedonia thanks to the Municipality of Volos. This Greek Public history symposium focuses on several aspects and issues that are central to Public History discussions in continental Europe.  I met one of the scientific promoter, Giorgos Antoniou, (School of Humanities, International Hellenic University, Thessaloniki, g.antoniou at ihu.edu.gr) at the European University Institute in Florence when he was a Ph.D. student in the History Department. In 2006, at the end of his stay at the EUI, Antoniou co-edited with Professor Luisa Passerini a special issue of the Italian contemporary history journal Memoria e Ricercaon the Memory of Civil Wars in contemporary Societies. Antoniou took recently part in our IFPH-FIHP panel Public History: Cohesive or Disruptive ? Remembering Civil Wars and Violent Sub-National Conflicts, at the annual Meeting of the National Council on Public History, (NCPH) in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, April 17-20, 2013, âKnowing your Public(s). The Significance of Audiences in Public Historyâ. This panel, as you can see below, focused on some of the themes that will be discussed during the Public History conference in Greece this month. Dirk Moses (European University Institute), will deliver the keynote speech on How and Why the Use and Abuse of History is Inescapable, Inevitable and Invaluable for Public Life; Simon Prince (Canterbury University) will deliver a paper on The Failure to Address the Past in Northern Ireland. I will talk about the âHistory of Public Historyâ: From Local to Global and back again: The History and Internationalization of Public History. Greek participants will analyze several key issues concerning Public Historians confronted with the use and abuse of history in today's Greek divided society.      Public History: Cohesive or Disruptive ? Remembering Civil Wars and Violent Sub-National Conflicts"When Public Historians address, through different media and languages, the history of Civil Wars with their opposed and contested memories, do they actually provide a better public understanding of the past? Telling the history of civil wars and violent turmoil is a slippery terrain for Public Historians, one that entails a serious risk. The irreducibly factious memories of civil wars serve to justify and sustain todayâs confrontation of political ideologies. Some national societies were -during their recent nation building processes- so heavily divided that their different communities engaged in destructive civil wars and violent confrontations. The opposed memories that emerge after such wars and confrontations, shape a reality characterized by a complex historical heritage and a complex mixtures of ideological deadlocks and political confrontations. The work of Public Historians becomes in such cases particularly difficult. If a Public Historian engages in the celebrations of Civil Wars in contemporary cultural and political debates or through historical museums  and exhibitions, websites and digital media, s/he has to be aware of the influence that opposed memories play in shaping the way through which past events are presented to the public. This raises a key question, having to do with the minimum requirements of a âcommonly accepted historyâ. Is being aware of the difficulties that dealing with opposed memories entails enough for a historian to write a commonly accepted history of Civil Wars? Or, on the opposite, is a commonly accepted history possible only many generations after the war has taken place, when opposed memories are likely to be forgotten, and the past can no longer be used to as a divisive tool? Civil Wars Public History deals with collective identities at different levels: from local memories to the construction of nationsâ common past. This is true also of the cases in which it is disputed whether a âCivil warâ actually occurred (e.g.  the resistance to the Vichy government in France or the Northern Ireland conflict)."-----------------------------------------------This is the English version of the conference program. USES AND ABUSES OF HISTORY:PUBLIC HISTORY IN GREECEMunicipality of Volos, Conference HallAugust 30th â September 1st 2013Friday August 30th 11:30 Opening â Welcome Opening Lecture12:00 - 12:30Serge Noiret (European University Institute, IFPH), From Local to Global and back again: The History and Internationalisation of Public History12.30-14.00Session Î: Internet and Public HistoryChairman: Andreas Andreou (University of Western Macedonia)Maria Bontila (PhD in History), Internet adventures of Public History: A case study.Dimitris Bilalis (University of Thessaly), The nation, the parasite and the virus.
