After last November and December’s adventures in cancer world, it isn’t surprising that I get a lot of questions about my health and emails wishing me well, often based on incomplete information. Â Of course since IÂ have incomplete information, that’s no wonder. Â So here’s some slightly more complete information. We’re back to watch and wait. Â Ideally, forever.Â But maybe not. When I saw my endocrinologist before I left for India on Jan 9th, he read my situation a little differently than the oncologist, as in he thinks I’m in a different class of patient (and was unworried enough to want to talk about teaching evaluations, which I took as a very good sign). But both of them are singing the same tune in terms of next steps. Â In a couple months (give or take) I’ll have a scan that will give us a sense of what’s happened since the “new” baseline set in December,Â and then we’ll do partial scans throughout the year. Â What they are looking for is when the cancer starts “trying to grow” at a considerably faster rate than it is right now. Â When that happens, the slow-growing thyroid cancer is trying to start behaving like a more aggressive cancer, so the drugs start. Â Once I’m on drugs, I’m probably on drugs forever. Â At least with the medicine at where it is at today. Â The thing is that “trying to grow” phase could come soon, or it could come in 10 years or even later. Â And there are no other experimental treatments to try right now (the lithium/radioactive iodine was their best shot). So now we pay attention every few months, and otherwise we suspend attention. Â “Watchful waiting” it’s called, but I like to think of it as blissful denial punctuated by periods ofÂ intense ambiguity. This is the best possible outcome at this stage, so around here we’re considering me lucky.
