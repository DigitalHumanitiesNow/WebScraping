Ok, I give up. It is time for me to enter in the arena and give my definition of Text, as I gave it during my last paper at DH at Reading.I argue that to determine what a text IS is not that complicated (?), whatâs complicated is to establish how it works and how it relates to its âsupportâ.So, here is my definition.A text is a linguistic architecture that conveys a meaning which is potentially understandable to at least one group of receivers which have the capabilities to decipher the code in which the message is encoded. With this definition I connect the theory of text with the theory of communication, but, mind you I am only speaking of texts contained, bared by manuscripts.Let's consider for a moment the following "classic" diagram of the theory of communication:                                  CODE         Source --> SENDER --> Channel --> RECEIVER --> DestinationMessage                       Noise                             MessageâIs this model helpful to understand texts within manuscripts? Let's try to understand what these terms mean in our case (i.e. digitised texts contained in manuscripts). Let's then have for the CodeLanguageGrammarSyntaxRhetoricOrthographyWriting system, conventionsâ¦Which are the factors that can make the code hard to decipher? The main are time and space, which is to say diachronic and diatopic variations which  force us to modify our diagramme as follows, inserting CODE' and CODE''.                  CODE'           CODE         CODE''Source --> SENDER --> Channel --> RECEIVER --> DestinationMessage                          Noise                           MessageâOf course, this factors are only the most common one when talking of ancient texts transmitted by manuscripts, but they are not by any menas , the only one. In fact, this new diagramme looks familiar to humanities people, in particular if we substitute the CODE with the terminology introduce be De Saussure:                 PAROLE       LANGUE      PAROLESource --> SENDER --> Channel --> RECEIVER --> DestinationMessage                          Noise                           MessageâSo, we have to add to differences in time and space also differences in understanding and personal usage of the language.Let's now consider the Channel, which in our case can be understood as follows:ScrollCodex (Manuscript)Printed bookThe screen of a computerThe screen of a mobile phoneAudioThe eyes/brain (perceptive network)And finally, let's consider the Noise, which, again in our case, can be foundIn the writing systemIn the writing conventionsIn the style of writingIn the supportIn the layoutIn the screen coloursIn the pronunciationIs this schematisation helpful to understand what is going on when doing a transcription, when, that is, we separate the text from its support?I think it shows, at very least, how much of interpretation and subjectivity this operation implies, pace all the supporters of the objectivity of the transcription. It also shows how many things can go wrong here and how much understanding and skills and business of transcription is...How can we reduce the distance between Message and Message' ? Well, I think I'll keep it for another post!
