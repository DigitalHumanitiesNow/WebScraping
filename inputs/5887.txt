Aleks Kolkowski has been recording all manner of contemporary artists with a 1909 Edison wax cylinder phonograph.  The results are pretty incredible.  I am especially fond of the electronic music section for its historical juxtapositions. (laptop + circuit bent keyboards + who knows?) + cylinder =   Meat Sweats Cylinder by phonographies  Theremin + cylinder =   Lydia Kavina Cylinder.mp3 by phonographies
