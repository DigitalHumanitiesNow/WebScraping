I watched this talk by Kevin Slavin at Mobile Monday Amsterdam three times already (which explains why it took me so long to post it here), and I still can't understand what are his issues with augmented reality. One claim is obvious, and I tend to agree, that immersion is neither necessary nor sufficient for an exciting experience. His other claims may be confusing (or misdirected), yet Slavin is a master of weaving together anecdotes from history and his own personal life into a compelling story, which makes the following video interesting to watch. (via Rhizome.org)
