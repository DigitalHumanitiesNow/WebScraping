Here is a recent documentary by a Finnish filmmaker which seems quite relevant to the digital living project! Five Star Existence – Sonja LindÃ©n (2011, 84 min)  With the world at our fingertips, does technology make us freer? Amidst all the hurry and worry of the modern information society, are we happier? These are the core questions of Finnish filmmaker Sonja LindÃ©nâs contemplative look at our wired existence. Our communication habits have changed drastically in the past 20 years. As the pace of technological innovation accelerates daily, expectations intensify in the workplace, where hectic multi-tasking and 24/7 availability are the norm. LindÃ©n also notes how our relationship to movement has changed; it is now possible to live a life entirely sitting down. But while the sedentary nature of playing video games results in spine problems for some young people, a computer mouse stuck to the forehead of a disabled woman has given her a new independent life. How does machinery affect our physical, emotional, and mental well-being? How can we rediscover a balance between our natural rhythm and the rapidly escalating demands of modern society? Beautifully shot and poetically paced, Five Star Existence was selected for International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdamâs Competition for Feature-Length Documentary. LindÃ©nâs sensitive, nonjudgmental treatment of these questions creates a heavily thought-provoking cinematic essay on the intertwining of machine and human being. See the trailer, here.
