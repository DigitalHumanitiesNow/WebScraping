At its meeting today, the THATCamp Council has agreed to post the following draft of an anti-harassment policy for editing and comment. This is revised version of the Code4Lib anti-harassment policy, which in turn is based on the Geek Feminism anti-harassment policy.We envision this as a document that all THATCamp organizers must agree to adopt before they can register a THATCamp. We’ll be taking comments this summer until August 30th (please comment on this blog post) and will produce revisions in accordance with those comments. We’ll vote to adopt the Code at the next THATCamp Council meeting, which will take place sometime in September 2014.
