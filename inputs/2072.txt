The inferential leap between the static archaeological record and our explanation of         dynamic past behaviours is always a challenging one, but computational and quantitative techniques can be         of great assistance. In particular, they can provide useful insight on patterns of human and animal movement,         by better characterising existing archaeological evidence, suggesting simple models of mobile decision-making         or proposing expected patterns of movement against which the observed record can be compared.
