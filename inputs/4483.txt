I’m pleased to announce a new collaborative undergraduate minor in Computing and Digital Technologies at the University of Notre Dame. Beginning next fall, students will be able to pursue a combination of tailored, rigorous instruction in computer programming and closely related coursework in the humanities, arts, and social sciences. There are six tracks within the minor, from UI design to cognitive psychology to digital humanities and more. It’s an interesting model, one that’s intended to allow our best and most ambitious students to undertake serious research before graduation and to gain the skills they need for success at the highest levels once they leave campus. I’ll be closely involved, serving on the advisory board for the minor, teaching CDT classes in the digital humanities track, and bringing strong students into my research group. We’re seeing more of these kinds of programs elsewhere, including Columbia’s “Computing in Context” courses and Stanford’s “CS+X” majors. There’s been talk here — though not yet any concrete plans — of eventually expanding CDT to a full major and of offering a BA in computer science through Arts and Letters. In the meantime, there may also be teaching opportunities in the program for qualified grad students. That last point reminds me: if you have outstanding students looking to do grad work in DH, I hope you’ll consider pointing them toward ND! In any case, exciting times. Looking forward to getting under way in August.Filed under: Digital Humanities, Teaching
