The Proceedings of THATCamp allows readers to browse blog posts from around the THATCamp network in several ways:Posts that many users have “favorited”Posts by most recentPosts by topicPosts by year and monthIn addition, there’s picture gallery of snapshots from THATCamp and (of course) a page where you can keep an eye on what people are saying about THATCamp on Twitter.Want to improve the Proceedings? You can “favorite” THATCamp posts others have written, categorize and tag THATCamp posts you’ve written, and post pictures to the THATCamp Flickr group. Read more about how to do all these things at About the Proceedings of THATCamp.Many thanks to the design and development team: Kim Nguyen, Boone Gorges, and Aram Zucker-Scharff.
