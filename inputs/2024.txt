The history of the Roman republic is the history of a highly competitive aristocratic elite, which oversaw Rome's remarkable transformation from middling Italian city-state to ruler of a world empire. A great deal of the basic information about the prosopography of the Roman elite has already been collated but the sheer scale and complexity of the material has made complex analysis impracticable. By creating a searchable digital database comprising all known members of the republican elite, the project will open up radically new opportunities for revisiting old questions as well as asking entirely new ones.
