The Day of DH 2015 website is now live, launching the community effort to answer the questionÂ ‘Just what do digital humanists really do?’ by blogging one day in the life of DH. Day of DH 2015 marks the first time the project, an initiative of centerNet, will be hosted outside of North America (by Laboratorio de InnovaciÃ³n en Humanidades Digitales at UNED in Madrid), and organizers are encouraging a bilingual Day of DH, withÂ English and Spanish versions of website content. Day of DH 2015 will take place on May 19th. Information about registering for an account, setting up a site on the community platform, or following along with activity, is available on the Day of DH website.
