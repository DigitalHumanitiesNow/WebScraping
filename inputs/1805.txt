 Editorâs Note: Each week, we reflect on the top articles, blog posts, tweets, news, thoughts, and other tidbits weâve found interesting or useful. Enjoy!  Hack Library School would like to take this time to congratulate all of our fellow contributing writers who will be graduating this month.Â Congratulations Class of 2015!  Courtney Baron, Valdosta State University, focus in academic librarianship with a concentration on the visual arts Amanda Davis, Valdosta State University, with a specialization in technology Nicole Helregel, University of Illinois, Certificate of Advanced Study with a concentration in library marketing Jasmine Burns, University of Wisconsin Milwaukee, concentration in Archive Studies  Kara My day job and my courses have kept me pretty busy these past few months but the light at the end of the tunnel has gotten just strong enough that I can see things not related to school or work. Here’s some things I’ve been perusing: -I caught this NPR story on the Library of Congress during my commute this week and found it very interesting. – I’m not aiming to become a school librarian but I think they’re fantastic. If you agree and you’re in the mood to donate some money, there’s a school librarian in Arizona whose students started a GoFundMe campaign when the funding for her position was cut. -In light of the recent ruling on the NSA, here’s a great piece on public libraries and information privacy. -Finally, the awesomeness of the Enoch Pratt library staff in Baltimore. I’ve only been a Baltimore resident for three years, but I like this city and I really like it’s library system. Â I like it even more sinceÂ last week, when the staffÂ kept each and every library locationÂ open despite violenceÂ and looting mere steps from the Pennsylvania Ave branch.Â The only disruption to normal hours was a slightly early closure on Monday during the worst of the riots. Thanks to the Enoch Pratt staff Baltimore had a place to go when it needed computer access, homework help, community resources, or just a safe, quiet place to gather its thoughts for a few hours. Hats off to them. Dylan This week, Alison Macrina (@flexlibris), director of the Library Freedom Project, was featured in a front page article in The Nation. It’s an awesome article.
