The Nation has a piece by William Deresiewicz called âProfessing Literature in 2008,â which presents a review of the Twentieth Anniversary edition of Gerald Graffâs Professing Literature.  Mostly, itâs the usual screed, though it does a make a few points that even this pre-tenured radical might have to concede.  I mention it here only to draw attention to the reviewâs most exhilarating moment â an âanalysisâ of the mla job list:     There have always been trends in literary criticism, but the major trend now is trendiness itself, trendism, the desperate search for anything sexy. Contemporary lit, global lit, ethnic American lit; creative writing, film, ecocriticismâwhatever. There are postings here for positions in science fiction, in fantasy literature, in childrenâs literature, even in something called âdigital humanities.â
