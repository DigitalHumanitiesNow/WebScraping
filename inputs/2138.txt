Today is the Day of DH, when digital humanities practitioners try to document what a "typical day" looks like in their engagement with digital humanities. There is an official site that hosts blogs from self-identified community membersÂ and which, due to technical difficulties, I can't currently contribute to. But that gives me a moment to list the various Stanford folks who are taking part in Day of DH and highlight their blogs: Linguistics, Philosophy, & Textual Research LibrarianÂ Jacqueline Hettel's Day of DH Digital Humanities Librarian Glen Worthey's Day of DH Academic Technology Specialist Jason Heppler's Day of DH Digital Humanities Research Developer Karl Grossner's Day of DH Digital Humanities Specialist Elijah Meeks' Day of DH If you are at Stanford and think of yourself as doing digital humanities scholarship, let me know and I will happily add you to the list.
