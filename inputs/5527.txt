CC License: http://photos.jdhancock.com/photo/2013-07-01-010715-computer-chip.html I’m looking for Ph.D. students who want to come work with me at Iowa State. If you are interested in social technologies and how they impact youth, please apply! This would be a funded position and you would work in my emerging research group that will be composed of Ph.D. and Masters students (and eventually advanced undergraduate students). I’m looking for students who are passionate about this research area. The ideal student will be creative in thinking about new research studies they could (eventually) run themselves and/or in thinking about how my existing data can be analyzed. Bonus points for coding and/or statistics skills. I’ve got a number of projects going right now: 1. Apps and Educational Success. This is a grant-funded project being conducted in collaboration with my colleagues at University of Michigan. We are evaluating a number of apps designed to help middle and high schoolers get to college as well as apps developed to support students already in college. 2. Big Data/Predictive Analytics. This is a large-scale project where over 400 students allowed me to monitor everything they did on their computers for a month. I also have personality data on the students, survey data, as well as institutional data. One of the goals is to discover predictive models that can help identify students at risk by only using trace data. 3. A project on online safety that’s currently in the works. 4. A project on digital technologies to improve self-regulation skills that’s also currently in the works. You can either apply as a Ph.D. student in Higher Education in the School of EducationÂ [Application linkÂ – Deadline December 1, 2014]. Or you can apply as a Ph.D. student in Human Computer InteractionÂ [Follow The PhD Graduate Program Application Process steps at the bottom of the pageÂ – Deadline January 15, 2015]. Let me know if you have any questions!
