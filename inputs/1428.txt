I’ve heard the lament in more than one library discussion over the years.Â  “People aren’t coming to our library like they should,” librarians have told me.Â  “We’ve got a rich collection, and we’ve expended lots of resources on an online presence, but lots of our patrons just go to Google and Wikipedia without checking to see what we have.”Â  The pattern of quick online information-finding using search engines and Wikipedia is well-known enough that it has its own acronym: GWR, for Google -> Wikipedia -> References.Â  (David White gives a good description of that pattern in the linked article.) Some people I’ve talked to think we should break this pattern.Â  With the right search tool or marketing plan, some say, we can get patrons to start with us first, instead of Google or Wikipedia.Â  This idea seems to me both futile and beside the point.Â  Between them, Google and Wikipedia cover a vast array of online information, more than librarians could hope to replicate or index ourselves in that medium.Â  Also, if we truly have better resources available in our libraries than can be found on the open Web, it’s less important that our researchers start from our libraries’ websites than that they end up finding the knowledge resources our libraries make available to them. Looked at the right way, Wikipedia can be a big help in making online readers aware of their library’s offerings.Â  One of the things we spend a lot of time on in libraries is organizing information into distinct, conceptual categories.Â  That’s what Wikipedia does too: so far,Â  their English edition has over 4 million concepts identified, described, and often populated with reference links.Â  And Wikipedia has encouraged people to add links to relevant digital library collections on various topics, through programs like Wikipedia Loves Libraries and Wikipedian in Residence programs.Â  But while these programs help bring some library resources online, and direct people to those selected resources, there’s still a lot of other relevant library material that users can’t get to via Wikipedia, but can via the libraries that are near them. So how do we get people from Wikipedia articles to the related offerings of our local libraries?Â  Essentially we need three things: First, we need ways to embed links in Wikipedia to the libraries that readers use.Â  (We can’t reasonably add individual links from an article to each library out there, because there are too many of them– there has to be a way that each Wikipedia reader can get to their own favored libraries via the same links.)Â  Second, we need ways to derive appropriate library concepts and local searches from the subjects of Wikipedia articles, so the links go somewhere useful.Â  Finally, we need good summaries of the resources a reader’s library makes available on those concepts, so the links end up showing something useful.Â  With all of these in place, it should be possible for researchers to get from a Wikipedia article on a topic straight to a guide to their local library’s offerings on that topic in a single click. I’ve developed some tools to enable these one-click Wikipedia -> library transitions.Â  For the first thing we need, I’ve created a set of Wikipedia templates for adding library links. The documentation for the Library resources box template, for instance, describes how to use it to create a sidebar box with links to resources about (or by) the topic ofÂ  a Wikipedia article in a reader’s library, or in another library a reader might want to consult.Â  (There’s also an option for direct links to my Online Books Page, if there are relevant books online; it may be easier in some cases for readers to access those than to access their local library’s books.) For the links to work, we need to know about the reader’s preferred library.Â  Users can register their preferred library (which will set a cookie in their browser recording that choice), or select it for each individual search.Â  We know how to link to several dozen libraries so far, and can add more libraries on request.Â  Worldcat.org, which includes holdings of thousands of libraries worldwide, is also an option.Â  Besides the “Library resources box” template, I’ve also provided templates for in-text links to library resources, if those work better in a given article.Â  Links to these templates can be found at the end of the “Library resources box” documentation. For the second thing we need, I’ve created a library forwarding service (“Forward to Libraries”, or FTL– catchier name suggestions welcome) that transforms links from Wikipedia into searches for appropriateÂ  headings or keywords in local libraries.Â  This is the same service I describe in my “From my library to yours” blog post from last month, but it now supports links from Wikipedia as well as to Wikipedia. Thanks to information included in the Library of Congress’ Authorities and Vocabularies datasets, OCLC’s VIAF data feeds, Wikipedia’s database downloads, and my own metadata compiled at The Online Books Page, FTL already knows how to link directly to over 240,000 distinct authority-controlled headings known to the Library of Congress from their corresponding Wikipedia articles.Â Â  (Library of Congress headings are used in most sizable US libraries, and many English-language libraries outside the US also use similar headings.) For other articles, FTL by default will try a general keyword search based on the Wikipedia article’s title, which will often turn up useful results at the destination library.Â  Alternatively, my templates allow Wikipedia editors to determine a specific Library of Congress heading to use in library links, if appropriate.Â  I’m hoping to incorporate suggested headings into FTL’s own knowledge base as I detect them showing up in Wikipedia articles.Â  I also plan to publish FTL’s data sets under open access terms, so that others can use and improve on them as well. The third part of this solution– displaying relevant resources at the destination library– can be implemented differently at each library.Â  For most of the libraries in FTL’s current knowledge base, links go to searches in the library’s regular online catalog.Â  But with some libraries, I’ve linked to another discovery system, if it seems to be the main search promoted at that library, and it seems to produce useful results.Â  The Online Books Page’s subject map displays also have features that I think will be useful to Wikipedia subject researchers arriving at my site, such as also showing related subjects and books filed under those subjects.Â  I hope in future posts to talk more about other useful guideposts and contextual information we could be providing to readers arriving from Wikipedia. But if you’ve read this far, you probably want to see how this all works in practice.Â  So I’ve added some example library resources boxes in a few Wikipedia articles that seemed particularly relevant this month, including those for Women’s history, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Flannery O’Connor.Â  Look down in the “External links” or “Further reading” sections of those articles for the boxes, and view the page source of the articles to see how those boxes are constructed. As with most things related to Wikipedia, this service is experimental, and subject to change (and, hopefully,Â  improvement) over time.Â  I’d love to hear thoughts and suggestions from users and maintainers of Wikipedia and libraries.Â  And if you find creating these sort of links from Wikipedia useful, and need help getting started, I’d be happy to help you bring them to your favorite Wikipedia topics and local libraries, as time permits.
