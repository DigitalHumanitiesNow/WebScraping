Ten research-intensive universities in the South of England will get more than Â£2,000 each year in quality-related research funding for every student at the institution. As shown in the following map, no institution in the North will get the same amount using the same measure, which takes each universityâs QR income and divides it by its student population. (click for larger version) The cartogram displays the country adjusted in shape to reflect population density. The circles show how the Higher Education Funding Council for Englandâs QR funding is distributed per student. From west to east, the map shows that Oxford, Imperial College London, the Courtauld Institute of Art, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, University College London and the University of Cambridge (the red circles) are among those that will each get more than Â£3,000 in QR per student a year. The University of Bristol, Kingâs College London, the Royal Veterinary College and Queen Mary University of London (the pink circles) will get between Â£2,000 and Â£3,000 per student each year. The concentration of red and pink circles in the South shows a stark divide in terms of QR funding.The content on this page has been created by Benjamin Hennig in collaboration with Danny Dorling and Holly Else for a contribution to Times Higher Education.
