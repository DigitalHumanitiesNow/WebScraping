In no particular order, I propose these two dozen…. Questions are more important than answers. Cooperating is more important than competing. Thinking is more important than knowing. Searching is more important than finding. Making is more important than having. Opportunities are more important than rules. Understanding is more important than achieving. Learning is more important than teaching. Conversation is more important than studying. Reactions are more important than rubrics. Student-student interaction is more important than student-teacher interaction. Active not passive. Never ask a question if you already know the answer. Silence is powerful. Let it go on. Watch faces. Don’t repeat what was just said. Learn ALL the names of EVERY student on the FIRST day. STEM without Arts is useless and dangerous. Â STEAM not STEM. Feelings are always relevant. Learning is joyous. Be a person first. Laugh at yourself. Care. The universe is the classroom, the classroom is not the universe.
