Tiltfactor is proud to announce the NEH and IMLS Co-Funded event toÂ discussÂ Future of Crowdsourcing atÂ #crowdconÂ    Hanover NHâ This week, lead organizersÂ Dartmouth College and the University of Maryland-College Park, announceÂ âEngaging the Public: Best Practices in Crowdsourcing across the Disciplines,â a workshop to gatherÂ by invitation over 60 leadersÂ from the humanities, sciences, and cultural heritage domains in order to move the national discussion about crowdsourcing forward. Projects like Tiltfactor’s Metadata Games are shaping the future ways in which institutions can interact with the public. The gathering will help guideÂ the Crowd Consortium for Libraries and Archives (CCLA) (going by CrowdConsortium.org), a new organization that identifies and addresses nationalÂ pressing needs and challenges regarding crowdsourcing in the cultural heritage domain. “It’s a chance for those across different domains to deepen theÂ conversation about crowdsourcing, so that we’re sharing code, best practices, and technical systems,” says Tiltfactor director and co-organizer Mary Flanagan. Neil Fraistat, Director of MITH, and Andrea Wiggins, Professor atÂ the I-School, University of Maryland, are also organizers. Participants include well-known humanities scholars, scientific researchers, and experts from a range of museums, research labs, libraries,Â archives, and other memory institutions. The organizers invite the public to listen in and participateÂ through theÂ live webcast of some of theÂ talks.Â Also those online mayÂ follow and engage with theÂ Â #crowdcon Twitter conversation.
