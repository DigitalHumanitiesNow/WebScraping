This is a syllabus in progress, imagined as part writing workshop, part American studies course on aesthetics. Comments and suggestions are welcome.What I Did For Love: Taste, Evaluation, and Aesthetics in American CultureâI donât know art, but I know what I like,â goes the disclaimer. In this writing-intensive part-workshop, part-seminar, we will seek to unpack the relationship between âartâ and âwhat I likeâ by examining a variety of cultural objects together with accounts of âtaste.â What are the uses of an art that nobody likes? Could âannoyanceâ be an aesthetic principle? What is the role of money in taste? What are the ethics of aesthetics? Under what circumstances is an aesthetic pleasure âguiltyâ? When should the appreciation of art works be a matter of disinterested judgment, and when a matter of passionate engagement? Does âloveâ blind? What is the difference between a âfanâ and a âcriticâ? What are the affordances and limits of the âformulaicâ and the âgenericâ?  Four weeks of this course will be devoted to workshopping studentsâ critical writing, examining the roles of description, praise, blame, analysis, and enthusiasm in writing about culture. Students will also maintain a course blog. For the final assignment, students are encouraged to pitch their writing to an appropriately chosen publication.

(These are two different things.) Explain why it is that you love the piece, what it is that makes it good, and how you can tell the difference (and under what circumstances   you canât). Be sure to explain what it is that makes art good in generalâyou donât need to advance a fully developed theory of aesthetics, but you do need   to unpack your assumptions as much as you can. Have an argument. This should be around 3000 words.

Your critique should be utterly devastating, which is to say that you should be able to persuade your reader that this piece is a blight on humanity, and not merely that you are a mean-spirited person. This will be more effective if you resist choosing an easy target. 2,000â3,000 words.
