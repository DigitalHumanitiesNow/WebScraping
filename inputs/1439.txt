My site for Digital History Documentary is up. It's not much, but then again I'd rather spend more time on my documentary than worrying about the design. This will be the third design for this one class site! It amazes me (and scares me) that I can't ever finalize a site's design. Open Season is killing me right now. There are so many things I want to do with that site, but it will have to wait for now, at least until the semester is over. Erik Barnouw's Documentary is an interesting read; more on that on my Documentary blog later. Unfortunately no Blockbuster in the Northern Virginia/DC Metro area has Ken Burns's The Civil War, Part 1 for rent. If I really enjoyed Civil War history I would probably buy the whole series, but I would much rather save my money for this, or this.  I've also considered making a site for my New Media readings with Roy. I'm ascertaining the current state of digital scholarship on the web, primarily history scholarship but I'm also looking at other humanities/social-science disciplines. I'd actually like to make a database to catalog all the sites I find and critique. Maybe when I get a little more proficient with PHP I'll do that.   *[PHP]: Hypertext Pre-Processor
