In our efforts to support the many THATCamps and their insights, discussions, products, and innovations, there has always been an infrastructure need for the THATCamp.org site to keep up, running, and responsive.We have made a step to make that much better, in moving THATCamp.org onto Reclaim Hosting.Reclaim has quickly become a favorite hosting solution among Digital Humanities and Ed Tech practitioners alike. Tim Owens’ (the brains and brawn behind Reclaim Hosting) diligence, responsiveness, and just plain capability have drawn the attention of all manner of folks who are interested in exploring online intellectual activity of all stripes.The work that Reclaim Hosting — and RRCHNM’s own server admin Roberto Sanchez — has done to move THATCamp.org onto Reclaim’s servers is deeply appreciated, and I anticipate a much improved experience for all THATCampers with this move.Many thanks to you all, and happy THATCamping!
