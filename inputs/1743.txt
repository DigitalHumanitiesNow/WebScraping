  (via)  Instead of providing immediate aesthetic pleasure, Almeida’s works are rich with layers that need decoding, and her sketchbooks serve as the key for doing so. On the cover of one of the books, the artist pasted what look like images of bejeweled medieval artifacts: a chalice, a disk (or is it a plate?), and a pitcher. These are the same motifs that are silhouetted, obscured or erased inÂ Silver ScreenÂ andÂ Forward/Play/Pause. In another sketchbook, precisely rendered streaks of blue ink call to mind refracted light rays. The drawing may suggest a mathematical model, but its deep, consistent color signals that the sketch is anything but a simple reflection of the physical world.Â   For the May 2014 issue of Art in America,Â I wrote aboutÂ Sonia Almeida at MIT’s List Visual Art Center.
