James broke the news to me this morning that our groupblog, Orals Fixation, has been added to the Cliopatria blogroll. I've been meaning to introduce it to everyone, but I seem to be a little too late since someone at Cliopatria found it.  James Halabuk, Stephanie Hurter, and I started Orals Fixation as a blog that serves as a sounding board or "thinking out loud" forum as we study for our major field oral exam in U.S. history. James, Stephanie, and I are taking our exams in the next few months. James is the administrator of the blog.  We're doing the brunt of our group study sessions over the summer, so plan to stop by the blog to see what we're up to and offer any advice you might have for some nervous but optimistic history PhD students.
