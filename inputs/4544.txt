 	We’re now offering unlimited storage subscriptions! There’s no longer any need to estimate how much storage you’ll need for your research projects in advance. Unlimited storage is priced at just $120 per year, equivalent to only $10 per month. 	Current Zotero users can subscribe or upgrade their plans immediately, and further details are available in our storage documentation. 	All current individual subscribers to storage plans 25GB and greater have received automatic upgrades to unlimited plans. We’re also offering an extra year of unlimited storage to those large-plan users who paid in the last 90 days. Subscribers to our discontinued 10GB plans have the option of remaining in those subscriptions as long as they desire. 	Subscribers can still choose the 2GB and 6GB plans, offered at $20 and $60 per year, respectively.
