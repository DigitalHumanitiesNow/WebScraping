  What do you know about Maker Culture? Give you an introduction to: Its history Some of the politics surrounding it Some of the things people do with it. Introduce and Demo the Arduino Microprocessor  Maker Culture, Maker Movement, MakerFaire Hackerspaces DIY Fabrication Maker Faires â there have been some in Portland.  Also Make Magazine Mostly Projects Featured Makers, Historical and Contemporary  MATERIAL CONSCIOUSNESS â Richard Sennett, a philosopher No sense of how we connect with technology. Blackbox idea: lots of technology that is literally âscreenedâ from us. We donât know how it works. Knowing materials through technique, through the fact that it registers our presence, and through our identifications with it. Move from merely abstract knowledge to hands-on forms of knowledge.  Next go to HISTORY. Rebellion against standardized forms of making. Textile Mills after Napoleanic wars Powered spinning or weaving of yarn from cotton Monday/Saturday 6AM-8PM No Safety Measures, amputations and deaths were common (those who couldnât work merely lost their jobs). One Mill at Cork â 60 mutilations in four years. Many workers were children (during 1830s, average age was 10) Long hours of doing the same thing all day. âdark, satanic millsâ â Blake.  Luddite Rebellion Rebelled against new developments in industrial technology Threatened to replace artisans w/ low-wage workers Mechanical knitting machines Ned Ludd allegedly smashed two frames in 1779  Luddites fought the British army, smashed mills. Parliament made âmachine breakingâ a capital crime w/ the Frame Breaking Act of 1812. Usually seen as against technology, but really against the emergence of low-wage work associated w/ standardized manufacturing.  Quotes from Marx: Note, that he had an optimistic view of technology. Makers distinguish between efficient forms of monetization and artisanal associations with technology. Blake never a Luddite, but searched for more artisanal associations with technology. 1757-1827 Wrote poetry, but also illuminated them and created watercolors. Thought he could speak with the dead and see angels in trees.  Known for his printing method. Mythologized it. Printing House in Hell. Illuminated Printing â from Medieval Illuminated Manuscripts, but allied w/ new printing technologies. Owned his own printshop. Would often work for commission during the day and do his art during the evening.  This is what one of his printing plates looked like. Illuminated Printing inverted intaglio printing process Intaglio: where images are cut into the surface of a plate and then the cut line holds the ink. Illuminated: use an acid-resistant wax to create image backwards, acid creates negative, then ink is transferred by the raised surface.  William Morris (1834-1896) admirer of Blake founder of the Arts and Crafts Movement: international design movement, appealed to medieval and folk forms of decoration. Wrote some of the first fantasy novels created early socialist movement in Britain forerunner of environmental movement.  Â The Dream of John BallÂ  (1888) â incorporates a lot of Blakeâs design work. About the Peasantâs Revolt of 1381 Victorian socialist time-travels to the middle ages. Private press published this first edition w/ Morrisâs designs.  Created artisanal, printed textiles Snakeshead printed textile from 1876. Rejected chemical aniline dyes which were really popular in the 19th C Emphasized organic dyes â indigo for blue, walnut shells for brown, madder for red. Wanted to create alternatives to industrial production methods, which he saw as horrible for the poor and as polluting the environment.  Next talk about POLITICS Political artists in the fields of design and computational making identify w/ term critical making Coined by Matt Ratto of U Toronto Idea that thinking is a hands-on process Also, that design or made-objects can comment on politics in some way.  One of Rattoâs projects was to 3d print a working gun Response to Cody Wilson, libertarian and director of an R&D firm who created the design. How does the government regulate guns that can be printed? How do we track them w/out serial numbers? How do we detect them in metal detectors? Do we make designs illegal? Are designs a form of speech?  Â Design directed against forms of public surveillance. Mark Shepardâs CC-D ME Not Umbrella uses LED lights to disrupt facial recognition software on CCD cameras. Shepard wanted âimages of city streets that are nearly unrecognizable.â  Example from Carl Di Salvoâs book Adversarial Design, where he discusses how design can engage in confrontational forms of political practice. Most interesting notion for me, is the idea that objects have a political life and a political influence particularly when so many of them are embedded in systems of surveillance or sending and receiving data.  Letâs take a 5 minute break and come back and talk about Arduino! Hold questions until after the demo session. Next we move to an introduction to ARDUINO. Arduino a microprocessor used in many of the projects in the Maker movement. Introduced in 2005 Over 700,000 were produced in 2013. Wanted it to be available to the open source community, rather than a proprietary technology. Lots of different variations. The most simple one is the Uno.  Uno has LED indicators Manual Reset Button USB type-B port to connect to computers External power source Several pins for holding lights or wires to other components.  Here are just a few of the components you can integrate. Main one weâre going to use today is the LED light. Arduino (like all programming) is really about controlling electrical current. Really good for teaching programming. Breadboard used to create circuits w/out the need for soldering. Resistors help to limit amount of current going to a device. Motors and servos help to provide negative feedback to translate current into precise mechanical control.  Do quite a bit w/ Arduino. Simple Project: Translate temperature sensors to digital temperature readouts.  Much more complicated project. Did at DHSI this past summer. Rebuilt 80s Missile Command cabinet. Used Makey Makeys and Raspberry Pis, and an emulator. Originally thought of using Arduinos. Former made more sense, but similar basic idea.  Demo Time!
