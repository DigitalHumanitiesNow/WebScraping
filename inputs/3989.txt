The graduate students in my fall 2014 class âProgramming for HistoriansââSara Collini, Peter Carr Jones, Jannelle Legg, Anne Ladyem McDivitt, George D. Oberle III, and Amanda Reganâand I will present the poster below at the 2015 annual meeting of the American Historical Association. This post is a (more or less) permanent version of the poster along with supplementary materials.   Figure 1: Poster: Teaching Graduate Students to Code [PNG, PDF] The projects created by the graduate students in the course, along with the code that they wrote, are available at their own websites. Below is a list of authors and project titles: Sara Collini, âNetwork Analysis of the Enslaved Community at Mount Vernon, 1786â1799â Peter Carr Jones, âMining the ICC: Macroanalysis of the Decisions of the Indian Claims Commissionâ Jannelle Legg, âMapping the Church Mission to Deaf-Mutes, 1873â1879â Anne Ladyem McDivitt, âNetworking the Early Video Game Industryâ George D. Oberle III, âA Network Analysis of Selected Organizations in the Early American Republicâ Allison Meyer OâConnor, âFireplaces: Heart of the Homeâ Amanda Regan, âMapping Gymnasiums in Boston, 1914â1925â Finally, two other links may be of use. The first is the syllabus for the course. The second is the ongoing draft of Digital History Methods in R, a book that I began writing during the semester to use as course materials.
