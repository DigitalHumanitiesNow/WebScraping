Some interesting work is going on with "block-level commenting," or the ability for readers/users to comment on specific portions or "blocks" of a post. Jack Slocum's example uses WordPress and the slick Yahoo! UI, while Tim Groves at Brand Spanking New offers something similar. I can imagine lots of uses for this with footnoting/endnoting scholarly writing on the web, and with critiquing publications and preprints.
