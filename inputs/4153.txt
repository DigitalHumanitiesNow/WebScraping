 Just finished a gem of a game called Gone Home: A Story Exploration Video Game. The game is simple. You are the older daughter returned to an empty home after a year in Europe. You wander around the house finding notes and other clues as to where your family is. In the process you uncover the stories of your parents, your sister and a dead uncle. The ending had me in tears â€“ proof for me that a game can evoke emotions.  The empty and mysterious mood reminds me of other games that use that mood like Dear Esther and even Myst.
