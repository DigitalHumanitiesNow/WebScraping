The Garden of Earthly Delights is a painting that overwhelms you. First of all, itâs big: over seven feet high and almost 13 feet wide when fully opened. The painting is a triptych which means that it is made up of three hinged panels.  When closed, the viewer is presented with a quiet image of the world: a monochromatic globe at the time of creation (see figure 1). Opened, the viewer is presented with a riot of strange images organized, it seems to me,  to roughly follow the concepts of the fall: paradise or the garden is the left-hand panel; temptation is the theme of the central panel; and the right hand panel shows the results of succumbing to temptation â hell and damnation. Figure  1: An image of the triptych, Garden of Earthly Delights, Heironymous  Bosch, 1505. this is the Creation image which is visible when the  triptych wings are closed.

Since we are building a prototype, we decided to select one panel to experiment with before going on to build the full game. We felt that the right hand panel, hell, was the most iconic which would be beneficial when it is time to raise more money to build the full game. However, we spent a considerable amount of time trying to understand Bosch and research some of the bigger issues around the painting as a whole and Bosch himself. To that end, the group watched a BBC documentary about the painting which was really interesting: Sarah Thompson, our art history subject matter expert, gave us some reading to start things off:God in the Details: Bosch and Judgment(s).

As a designer, it is that question asked at the beginning of the process: What do I want them to walk away with? Iâm really interested in trying to create games that will draw players in and engage them with a rich experience. Something to make them think a little differently, ask some questions or learn something. To that end, the team spent a lot of time discussing educational goals and themes. Of course, Bosch doesnât make it easy for us. The Garden of Earthly Delights is filled with symbolic meaning and reference, much of it long forgotten. Even the name is open for debate. It was referred to as The Strawberry Painting for many years due to the prevalence of strawberries in the painting and was only given the title of the Garden of Earthly Delights fairly recently in its history.We discussed a number of ideas that seemed interesting:visual inspiration -Reversal of scale (manuscripts with borders) and courtesy manualsIdeas of heaven and hell continued from ideas formed in the middle ages and continue on: hell is the disintegration of the body and heaven is the restoration to an ideal form. The material world is deceptive and not one on which you should base your spiritual decisions.Our educational goals we decided should focus on some big picture items that the painting expresses:   Â·         We wanted the game to allow players to learn about the artists original intentions, as much as we could. What do scholars think that Bosch meant by the symbolism in the imagery?Â·         We also want players to be able to form their own interpretations and relate the painting to contemporary lifeÂ·         Vision. We wanted to explore different ways of seeing and how this concept is different between medieval, Renaissance and contemporary viewers.Â·         For example, a medieval understanding of vision is based on the limitation of human and animal vision when compared to divine vision. Â·         Main thematic element: It is difficult in life to find a true, spiritual path among all the earthly temptations. We should not look to the material world to give us help in finding this path, as you canât trust what you see. IntertextualityIf we think of the painting in terms of what it expresses, that is, its content, then we can read it as a text. Intertextuality, speaks to the notion of texts being shaped by other texts. This can happen directly, as in parody and pastiche, or more indirectly as all ideas have been shaped by previous encounters with other texts. For our purposes, we were interested in how this painting related to other ideas, as expressed in paintings, objects and texts of the time. No object or text exists in isolation but is connected, through the common culture of its time, to other things. We wanted to try to capture this web of relationships and ideas of the late gothic and early Renaissance in Europe. We will include elements and references to other objects and texts that are linked to the Garden thematically and are relatively contemporaneous. There were some immediate connections that came to mind:The Ship of Fools, published by Sebastian Brant in 1494. A popular illustrated book with woodcuts thought to have designed by Albrecht Durer, this was a very popular work and Hieronymus Bosch painted a related work called, The Ship of Fools.A painting by Breugel the Elder, Proverbs. It has visual representations of popular proverbs, some of which are familiar but many of which sound a little strange to us today.http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/bruegel-the-dutch-proverbs.html Poetry and literature Guillaume de MachautRobert Greene, Pandosto: The Triumph of TimeThomas Lodge, RosalyndeRomances? (Roswell and Lillian, Generides) Diary excerpts : Venice, CitÃ  Excelentissima: Selections from the Renaissance Diaries of Marin SanudoOur next step will be to bring all of this into the design of the game narrative and mechanics. The trick will be to tie everything back to these core thematic anchors. If we can create interesting mechanics, art and narrative that all help to express  the thematic core, then the game should resonate with motifs, deep meaning, and opportunities for player created interpretation.To see the project introduction and team, see the previous postPlaying int he Garden with BoschNext in this series: art concepts.
