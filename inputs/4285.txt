Hi, thanks for your question. That sounds like a terrific angle, and one I hadnât really thought about but makes sense now that I see where you are going with it. The person who has done the most research on Victor Green isÂ  Gretchen Sullivan Sorin, who wrote her dissertation on the GB. She is the only one I know of who has had access to the family archives and papers and I think it would make sense to start there. I have her cited in my further reading as well as a link to her page at the Cooperstown graduate program, which she directs. Let me know what you find out and keep us posted on the progress of your project.
