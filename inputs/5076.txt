Pleiades provides geospatial data to dozens of digital projects, but it can also be used as a pedagogical tool in the classroom. Students in Sarah Bond's 'Ancient Financial Crisis' class used Pleiades data and the AWMC's Antiquity Ã€-la-carte tool in order to make maps of the sites involved in the Third Servile War (73-71 BCE) led in part by Spartacus, and then mapped the course of the slave rebellion through the terrain of Republican Italy.
