     In three hours, I’ll be on a leaving on a jet plane…heading to Kuwait and Qatar! I’m currently enrolled in a class called Seminar in Public Art: Spatial Cultural Identity, part of MIT’s Art, Culture, and Technology department. We’re taking a comparative look at the intersections of public space, art, and culture in Boston, Kuwait City, and Doha. I’ll report back here about my adventures. You can also follow my exploits on Twitter.
