Hi folksâfor the next two weeks, I’ll be hopping around Europe for some pretty exciting adventures. First stop:  Venice! In fact, I just stepped off the vaporetto and onto the Floating City about an hour ago. I’ll be here for four days, exploring the sites, sounds, alleyways, and canals. I’ll also be checking out the Venice Biennale for architecture, and in particular Kuwait’s pavilion, Acquiring Modernity. As I’ve mentioned in previous posts, the Kuwait biennale team took us under their wing when my class visited them in March, and in exchange, we learned all about their project. I’m excited to see the culmination of a year’s worth of planning!  Lausanne, Switzerland. Lausanne, a small city looking onto Lake Geneva and the Alps, is why I’m in Europe in the first place. I’ll be here with colleagues from HyperStudioâmy lab at MITâand we will be at the Digital Humanities 2014 conference. I’ll be helping the team out atÂ a workshop on Annotation Studio, our open, collaborative online annotation platform. Additionally, fellow research assistant Liam Andrew and I will be giving a short paper called “Rethinking Recommendations: Digital Tools for Art Discovery.” You can read our abstract online.   And finally, the Netherlands. A good friend of mine moved to Utrecht in January, and I’m excited to see what his life is like there. I’ve already bombarded him with a long list of art/architecture things we need to visit, including the Rijksmuseum, the Stedelijk, the Van Abbemuseum, the SchrÃ¶der house…any and all recommendations are welcome!
