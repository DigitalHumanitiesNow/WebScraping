This Fall I will teach three courses, all of which inform digital studies in different ways: Cyberpunk Cinema is a film course that engages the digital thematically while developing a critical vocabulary to analyze cinema. Introduction to Poetry will show how the most intense use of language is shaped by embodied, physical, and digital materials. My Digital Humanities Internship will offer 6 students the chance to collaborate in my projects, developing valuable 21st century digital technology skills. Read the descriptions below for more details.
