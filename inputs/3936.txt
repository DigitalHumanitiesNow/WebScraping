Hello, THATCampers!Many of you know that the THATCamp website has become slow to unresponsive, at best. We here at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media have been trying a variety of attacks on speeding things up to match the intellectual pace of our campers.Alas, that has largely been to no avail. So far.We noticed that there is an end-of-semester lull in THATCamp activity during December, and so we will take advantage of that to try more drastic actions in server configuration and caching tools.Thus, thatcamp.org will be down for maintenance on December 2nd. We hope the changes will be completed promptly within that day, and that the results will bring us back to being able to support your THATCamps.Something comes up that calls for quick attention, please email *protected email*.Thanks, and happy holidays! Dr. Patrick Murray-John THATCamp Council Chair
