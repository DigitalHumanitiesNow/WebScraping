CBC and others are reporting on a new Nintendo Creators Program where NintendoÂ will take a percentage of the ad revenue associated with a YouTube channel or video with playthroughs (Let’s Play) of their games. SeeÂ YouTube gaming stars blindsided by Nintendo’s ad revenue grabÂ or Nintendo’s New Deal with Youtubers Is A Jungle Of Rights. This will The Nintendo Creators Program presents this in their Guide as an opportunity to make money off their copyrighted materials, In the past, advertising proceeds that could be received for videos that included Nintendo-copyrighted content (such as gameplay videos) went to Nintendo, according to YouTube rules. Now, through this service, Nintendo will send you a share of these advertising proceeds for any YouTube videos or channels containing Nintendo-copyrighted content that you register. This program is only for “copyrighted content related to game titles specified by Nintendo”. This is probably because Nintendo has to be careful to not be seen as making money off playthroughs of other publisher’s games. This new policy/program raises interesting issues around: Fair use. Is a screen shot or a whole series of them that make up a playthrough covered by “fair use”? My read is that the publishers think not. Publicity from Playthroughs. YouTuber’s like PewDiePie who post Let’s Play videos (and make money off their popular channels) argue that these videos provide free exposure and publicity. New Economic Models for Gaming. Is Nintendo exploring new economic models tied to their copyright? Nintendo has been suffering so it makes sense that they would try to find ways to monetize their significant portfolio of popular game franchises and characters.
