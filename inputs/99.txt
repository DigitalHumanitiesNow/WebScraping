 So my soon-to-be-formerÂ Raw StoryÂ cohort Arturo Garcia and I decided we had things to say about the sixth season ofÂ Community, and what better place to say them then in a podcast?* It contains spoilers for all episodes up to the fourth as well as rampant speculation as to how the season would conclude in an ideal world. *I say "soon-to-be-former" because I got a new gig as a staff writer/assistant editor atÂ SalonÂ and my thinking is, "life-altering announcements are always best made in footnotes." I start in mid-April and will have more details about what I'll be doing there in the next few weeks. Â Listen to the podcast here.
