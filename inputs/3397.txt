Adrienne Rich has been an important figure in my life. I first encountered her work in my early teens, on the shelves of Internationalist Books in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. She said of her own work, that although she had been born a woman, she “was trying to think and act as if poetry–and the possibility of making poems–were a truly universal–that is, gender-neutral realm.”  I switched my major from women’s studies to information systems largely because I encountered the free software movement (also in Internationalist Books!), which blew my mind with a radical re-conceptualization of what the means of production could really mean. Like Adrienne and poetry, I felt the thrill of loving something enough to work hard at it. And I believe that I have been able to (try most of the time to) think and act as if my chosen field is truly universal because Adrienne Rich showed me how.  Thank you, Adrienne. Rest in peace. http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/29/books/adrienne-rich-feminist-poet-and-author-dies-at-82.html
