Online learning requires a meticulous attention to the container and the permeability of that container. We need to recognize that the best learning happens not inside courses but between them. Every course must outgrow its container. Digital pedagogues learn best by forgetting -- through continuous encounters with what is novel, tentative, unmastered, and unresolved. Itâ€™s especially important that we open our discussions of the future of education to students, who should both participate in and help to build their own learning spaces.
