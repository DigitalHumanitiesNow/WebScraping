Number 04: Actual Source (via It’s Nice That) Early last month I was invited to take part in the Art + Feminism Wikipedia edit-a-thon at Babycastles by stopping by, âmid-thon,â to offer a little food for thought, a little epistemological interjection. I have no particular expertise in Wikipedia, but I do research and teach classes on knowledge institutions and structures: libraries, archives, exhibitions, communications infrastructures, filing systems, classification systems, etc. So the intellectual and political concerns that likely inform Wikipedians’Â work also inspire my own. Thanks to some scheduling snafus, that presentation on March 9 didnât happen as planned, so I posted my talk online — and then Ari Spool, from Babycastles (she also happens to be a former student and my current TA), invited me to join you here tonight to share some of the ideas I wouldâve shared then.Â So, here it is, with some small adjustments: The March 9 Art + Feminism edit-a-thon- at MoMAÂ resulted in the expansion of a number of female artistsâ biographies â Lucy Lippardâs, Janet Cardiffâs, Hella Jongeriusâs â and the creation ofÂ new ones: LaToya Ruby Frazierâs, Toshiko Moriâs, Camille Henrotâs. But on March 10 we found ourselves hosting yet another edit-a-thon in a radically different kind of space, far from 53rd Street. Consider the relationship between those two institutions â MoMA and Babycastles â and how the institutional (and architectural and cultural and ideologicalâ¦) differences mightâve differentiatedÂ the work that went on in those related-but-separate events. The MoMA edit-a-thon involved theÂ insertion of myriad ânotableâ feminist artists, curators, art historians, etc., into Wikipedia.Â Notability is, of course, a key currency in WikiWorld. The Babycastlesâ crew, I hoped, would expand the notion of notability â in part by thinking about the kinds of art that MoMA had been seriously thinking aboutÂ asÂ art only relatively recently: video games, net art, and other techno-aesthetic projects. Another potential advantage, or distinction, of the Babycastles crowd, I assumed, was a widespread recognition that âartâ â or, more broadly, the aesthetic â doesnât reside merely at the level of theÂ exhibitable: the work that hangs on a wall or plays on a monitor and gets a wall label. Artâs also in the code; itâs in the servers and conduits; itâs in the preservation strategies and archives. Itâs in the myriadÂ intertwined infrastructures that make digital art â and, really,Â allÂ art â possible. Another group of folks with a similar sensibilityÂ includesÂ librarians and archivists and preservationists â all of whom have made key contributions to the art world, and to media and technological history, but who are often regarded as, or âreducedâ to, the organizers, the sorters, the tidy-ers, the care-takers.Â But this care-taking, this organization-making, is intellectualÂ andÂ aestheticÂ andÂ political work.Â Notable work. Consider two women â both of whom happen to haveÂ their own Wikipedia entries already: First, Megan Prelinger, one halfÂ of the Prelinger Archive and Library duo, whose collaborative work reinforces the informational and historical value of quotidian artifacts and ephemera and âoccasionalâ publications. She and her partner, Rick, mine historyâs discard pile. They also advocate for alternative means of organizing information: their library in San Francisco is organized according to scales of exploration, from the local to the intergalactic â from San Francisco to Outer Space. Second,Â Suzanne Briet (note to self: pronounced “Bray”), a French librarian who lived from 1894 to 1989, who encouraged folks to consider what constitutes, and whatÂ counts as, a document. She advocated for the valuation of âgrey literature,â correspondence, the information in phone calls â even animals. She suggestedÂ that even an antelope could be a âdocumentâ in a zoo, where it is made an object of study, where itâs âtaxonomizedâ and used asevidenceÂ of something.Â She also noted that documents are products of culture â whatÂ countsÂ as a document is determined in part by its cultural context, as in the case of ourÂ antelope â and that culture plays a key role in our understanding of how weÂ interpretÂ  Her insights pertain the edit-a-thonâs mission: they were turningÂ female artists into subjects worthy of documentation, and creating a culture where those documents are validated and valued. While I do agree that itâs critically important that females and artists â and, of course, female artists â are well represented both among theÂ contributors toÂ Wikipedia and theÂ subjectsÂ ofÂ its entries, I think itâs just as significantÂ to think about what it means to be a Wikipedia âsubject.â And about what, andÂ how, Wikipedia itself means. Iâm asking here about feminist historiography and epistemologyÂ (approaches that have not been without controversy!).  LetâsÂ consider some of these questions: How does Wikipedia structure knowledge? What does it suggest isworthÂ knowing? Who is a ânotableâ figure worthy of inclusion? To be considered for inclusion, an artist, for example, might have had aÂ âsignificantâ exhibition. Whose âsignificanceâ are we talking about? Or she might have âoriginatedâ aÂ âsignificant new technique.â Again, says who? What kinds of histories does Wikipedia promote? A biographically-focused one, judging by the historiographic methods employed in many edit-a-thons. As the late historian Roy Rosenzweig wrote in 2006, in a very prescient article in The Journal of American History, âbiographies of historical figures offer a more favorable terrain for Wikipediaâ â in part because biographies are popular, and because the âunit of analysis is always clear cut.â (Thanks to Trevor Owens for the reference!) How does the siteâs architecture â the linear text, the infobox, the heading structure, the bibliographies and external links â structure how we think about and write history? And given the edit-a-thonâs focus on art, it might be worth thinking, too, about the siteâs aesthetics: what roles do Wikipediaâs ascetic look-and-feel play in the conception of history and the shaping of knowledge? How do we reconcile Wikipedia’s insistence on a âneutral point of viewâ â which Rosenzweig calls âhighly conventional, even old-fashionedâ â with some feminists’Â acknowledgment of knowledge as âsituatedâ and embodied? Could we potentially intervene insteadÂ on a structural or an aesthetic level, to make Wikipedia reflect a more feminist epistemology or historiography? Could Wikipedia embody someÂ alternative to the âGreat Man Theoryâ of how the world works? How might we think of infusing a little feminist sensibility (again, whatever that means!) through means that goÂ beyondÂ creating new entries for âforgottenâ or âignoredâ female figures (which is itself, of course, a valuable enterprise)? What if we instead wrote women â and feminist valuesÂ â into Wikipediaâs existing macro-narratives? What if we sought to reconcile âneutralityâ with âsituatednessâ? Is such a reconciliation possible? What if we edited entries in light of the understanding that history is the product of collective action, of minute events with rippling effects, rather than the heroic acts of ânotableâ individuals? And what if we thought about the siteâs technical architecture and protocols â the link, the citation, and other writing conventions â as processes, or acts, that could be âfeminizedâ?Â And what would that even mean? The early-April edit-a-thons involved editing existing entries for female artists, and writing new artists into Wiki-history. Thatâs fabulous. But letâs think also about how that history is shaped, and what politics our Wiki-historiography embodies. And if that history reflects the values that might underlie a world in which âevery single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge.â
