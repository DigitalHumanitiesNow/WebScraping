 “BMC labs and David Cronenberg are going where no biotech startup has gone before. As the film industry struggles to evolve, Cronenberg once again proves that he is ahead of his time – striking an eight-figure licensing deal for the fictional IP found within his films.” – Filmmaker Magazine Body/Mind/Change (BMC), a digital extension of TIFF’s exhibition David Cronenberg: Evolution, immerses audiences in a “Cronenbergian” world inspired by the film Videodrome, re-imagined for the 21st century and brought to life across three platformsâ online, mobile, and real-world. Co-produced by the Canadian Film Centre’s Media Lab (CFC Media Lab) with creative direction by Lance Weiler, Body/Mind/Change features plot lines and game mechanics involving biotechnology start-ups, body enhancements, emotional learning systems, and presents the plausible science fiction found in Cronenberg’s work as scientific fact. via @nathanjurgenson
