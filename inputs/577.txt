We invite University of Nebraska-Lincoln alumni, students, and friends to help transcribe digitized documents. The first project is the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Cornhusker  Yearbooks, featuring a wide spectrum  of university history. The  Cornhusker yearbooks are currently available online at http://yearbooks.unl.edu for everyone to read, but they aren’t yet searchable. We need your help  to create transcriptions that will allow greater access to these  documents. You can start by clicking on the “Transcribe Yearbooks” option below or by reading the transcription tips we have provided. If you would like to set up an account,  it will help you keep track of your own transcriptions, and will help  us to acknowledge your valuable contributions to this project.
