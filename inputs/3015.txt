I have just added the following digital resource to the Electra Atlantis feed aggregatortitle = RIDE: A review journal for digital editions and resourcesurl = http://ride.i-d-e.de/creators = Alexander Czmiel, et al. (eds.)license = Â http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/description = RIDE is a review journal dedicated to digital editions and resources. RIDE aims to direct attention to digital editions and to provide a forum in which expert peers criticise and discuss the efforts of digital editors in order to improve current practices and advance future developments. It will do so by asking its reviewers to pay attention not only to the traditional virtues and vices of any edition, but also to the progressing methodology and its technical implications.feed = http://ride.i-d-e.de/feed/
