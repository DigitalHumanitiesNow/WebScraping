Come to our NCPH session, this Thursday morning at 8:30 as part of the NCPH annual meeting in sunny, convenient Monterey. How can co-created projects become a sustainable part of our work?Â  This roundtable includes participants who have facilitated recurring co-created exhibits and other projects involving museums, community organizations, students, artists, and other diverse partners. We will discuss the best practices that have emerged from ongoing collaborative projects, followed by a robust discussion with the audience as we collectively outline how we can sustain the co-created projects that keep our institutions responsive, challenging, and vital. Facilitator: Suzanne Fischer, Oakland Museum of California Presenters: Lisa Junkin Lopez, Jane Addams Hull-House Museum Benjamin Cawthra, California State University, Fullerton Deborah Mack, National Museum of African American History and Culture Evelyn Orantes, Oakland Museum of California
