Just a short post to point to a source of some really interesting map data: MapCruzin.com If you’re looking for modern US map data, they’ve got some really interesting datasets to download, including toxic waste and census data. In addition, they have a few datasets for England which include waterway data, which really interested me. The depth of coverage of the waterway data is patchy, but there are some areas (including my area of interest!) where there’s really really indepth coverage of everything down to streams. Best of all, it all comes as SHP files!
