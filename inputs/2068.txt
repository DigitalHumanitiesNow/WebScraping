The Codex Sinaiticus Project is an international collaboration to reunite the entire         manuscript in digital form—text, high quality images, and metadata—and make it accessible to a global         audience for the first time. Drawing on the expertise of leading scholars, conservators, and curators, the         Project gives everyone the opportunity to connect directly with this famous artefact. This seminar will present         the concept behind the digital edition of this manuscript.
