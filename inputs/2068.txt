Day FourWe spent the day working on web design issues and improving our web site.  Later in the day, an alert was sent out regarding a bug in the Ruby on Rails framework.  This evening, I received an email from Heroku on how to fix the bug:How to Upgrade:Open the Gemfile in the affected application and change the Rails version to one listed above:    rails '3.2.11'Then run:    $ bundle update railsThen commit the results to git, and push to Heroku:    $ git push heroku masterRepeat  for any susceptible applications. If you cannot upgrade at this time, please consider enabling maintenance mode or  scaling your app down to zero dynos. Any applications running an  insecure version are at risk.Here is the code for interested parties: https://gist.github.com/4506402Useful Tools and Web Sites encountered over Day FourDigital Humanities Pedagogy: http://www.openbookpublishers.com/reader/161CSS Mania: http://www.cssmania.com/CSS Specifity Wars: http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/css_specificity_wars.html Color Scheme Designer: http://colorschemedesigner.com/CSS Drive: http://www.cssdrive.com/  SimpleBits: http://simplebits.com/HicksDesign: http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/  Ruby on Rails Guides: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/
