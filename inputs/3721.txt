I’ve now been shaving for 10 months, which means I have the skills of a 14-year-old or thereabouts.  I’m still learning this whole thing.  So I’m at the gym last week and shave after my shower.  It was my first shave at the gym.  I had my rig all set up, and a minute or two into the enterprise, two other guys walk in, plop down their shaving kits, and go to it.  They finished well before I did and walked away.  While I’m not normally a “compare yourself to other men at the gym” kind of guy, I somehow found this episode slightly humiliating.  So I decided to try and shave faster.   You can guess what happened.  Last evening as some friends arrived to go out to dinner, I hadn’t quite finished bleeding profusely from a giant gash in my chin.   At least now I know how it is that men come to have giant nicks in their chins from time to time. To add insult to injury, I felt compelled to explain to them (none of whom had ever seen me with a beard) that I had only been clean shaven for a few months and was still figuring it all out.
