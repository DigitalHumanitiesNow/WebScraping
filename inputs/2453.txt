If you’re on a PC, the instructions we posted here:Â http://www.themacroscope.org/?page_id=418Â work. It’s a macro, in visual basic, for excel. But after a long back and forth yesterday with @thomasgpadillaÂ we worked out that it would break in various Mac versions of Excel. Why? I do not know. But there’s a pretty simple command line sequence on a Mac that’ll do the trick. We split it into big chunks, then split the big chunks into smaller chunks. So, grab a moderately large CSV (like John Adams’ diary, 1025 entries, 1 per row)Â and fire up your terminal thusly: $ split -l 200 johnadams-diary.csv 200out $ split -l 1 200outaa aa $ split -l 1 200outab ab $ split -l 1 200outac ac $ split -l 1 200outad ad $ split -l 1 200outae ae $ split -l 1 200outaf af  and so we get a series of files, aaaa aaab aaacâ¦. aeaa aeab aeacâ¦ until all 1025 rows are their own file. But they donât have extensions. So: find . -type f -exec mv '{}' '{}â.csv \; will recursively go through the current folder, finding files, and appending .csv to them. Ta da! [edit] sometimes you should read the manual. The error message I was getting when I split the original file one line at a time was ‘file too big’. But of course, that’s because of the default names a-z by a-z, so only 676 combinations, which means that yes, 1025 lines *is* too big… but, if you tell split to use a three-letter prefix, you can split up to 17576 lines. The -a flag lets you make this change, like so: split -a 3 -l 1 johnadams-diary.csv which is what I should’ve done in the first place. D’oh! Ah well: you don’t have to know everything in digital history. Work it out in public, and somebody is sure to let you know how you could’ve done it better ;) Happily, I caught this fairly quickly after I made my first post – but how much more elegant if I’d gone for the best solution right away? Well, sometimes, the best solution, is the one that works when you need it to.
