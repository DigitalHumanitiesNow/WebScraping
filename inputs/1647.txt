The book that Ann Kelly (my wife) and I have been working on for the last year is now available on the Manning Early Access Program (MEAP).  Here is the link:http://manning.com/mccreary The final title of the book will be:Making Sense of NoSQL: A guide for managers and the rest of us You can download chapter 1 for free but to get the other three chapters you will need to be part of the MEAP program which is priced at $23.99 for the Ebook only and $29.99 if you would also like a printed copy sent to you when the book is done. We are looking for reviewers of the book.  We are especially interested in finding anyone that has an interest in how to explain NoSQL concepts to non-programmers.  This includes Managers, Project Managers, Business Analysts and anyone else that is interested in using NoSQL. I believe this this is one of the first NoSQL books that is targeting managers and other non-programmers.  In order to write to a general audience we are trying to use extensive tables and annotated graphics to make a highly readable book that give people an overall understanding of the NoSQL movement.  Much of these tools have been developed by Ann and myself over the last several years trying to explain NoSQL concepts as part of our consulting business. If you know of good NoSQL metaphors or even NoSQL jokes that we can include in the book please let us know!  We will be very involved in the Manning Author feedback program.
