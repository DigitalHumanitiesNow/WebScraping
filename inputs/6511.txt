 We just posted a new job post Job: Library Developer at LibraryThing (Telecommute). To sweeten the deal, we are offering $1,000 worth of books to the person who finds them. That’s a lot of books. Rules! You get a $1,000 gift certificate to the local, chain or online bookseller of your choice. To qualify, you need to connect us to someone. Either you introduce them to usâand they follow up by applying themselvesâor they mention your name in their email (âSo-and-so told me about thisâ). You can recommend yourself, but if you found out about it from someone else, we hope youâll do the right thing and make them the beneficiary. Small print: Our decision is final, incontestable, irreversible and completely dictatorial. It only applies when an employee is hired full-time, not part-time, contract or for a trial period. If we donât hire someone for the job, we donât pay. The contact must happen in the next month. If weâve already been in touch with the candidate, it doesnât count. Void where prohibited. You pay taxes, and the insidious hidden tax of shelving. Employees and their families are eligible to win, provided they arenât work contacts. Tim is not.
