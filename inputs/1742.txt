During the month of December I am participating in #reverb14 as a means of getting my writing habits back on track. I will be  altering the prompts as needed to fit within the scope of this blog.  Today's prompt: One word. What one word could describe your 2014?Transformative. I learned a lot this past year and made a number of significant life changes. This year has been the year of new experiences, new skills, and learning moments. Some of the most transformative moments include:Participating in Walking With Our Sisters Sault Ste MarieBeginning to learn to play the hammered dulcimer and learning more about traditional musicReevaluating my historical tour skills and taking new approaches to teaching others about residential schoolsActing as a thesis supervisor Becoming a parentA year of change both professionally and personally.
