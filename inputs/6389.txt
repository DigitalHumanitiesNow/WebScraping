Where the use of an image clears the limitations, based on the four factors of fair use, that use may be fair and treated as such. Doing so may well be contrary to industry practice, but thatâs the âculture of permissionâ that the CAA is addressing. Theyâre not saying to reuse images willy-nilly because it makes the book prettier; theyâre saying that certain uses are allowed in the absence of permission if the use accomplishes an analytic object and is represented in an appropriate size/resolution to accomplish that end, etc.
