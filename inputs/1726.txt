Yesterday I participated in a webinar hosted by ALT, to introduce the recently published special issue of Research in Learning Technology on “the Art and Science of Learning Design“. That special issue, which emerged from the Art and Science of Learning Design workshop, includesÂ 9 papers by 22 authors, on a variety of core issues, representations, practices and tools for learning design. Seven of the authors who contributed to the special issue joined me:Â ValÃ©rie Emin-Martinez, Helen Walmsley, Michael Derntl, Liz Masterman, Luis P. Prieto. The session was chaired byÂ Caroline Greves, and supported behind the scenes by Martin Hawksey. Inter alia, we introduced the LDSE Learning Designer, OpenGLM, ScenEdit, Â the Metis project and its Integrated Learning Design Environment.
