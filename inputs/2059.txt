We will discuss the technical realisation and efficiency of several dimensions of detecting citations and apply         them in the field of the Plato's aftermath. Central parts of this presentation are graph based approaches. Based on substantial         experience of an ongoing collaboration between researchers of Classical Studies and Computer Science we shall also reflect on the         different approaches to working with text.
