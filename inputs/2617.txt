I recently got in touch with Professor Roy Wisbey, who set up the University of Cambridge's Linguistic Computing Centre in 1960, to invite him to my inaugural lecture. He is not able to attend (but passes on his regards to those who know him!) and he also briefly loaned me this newspaper article, from 24th September 1965, from the Cambridge News. A very early piece of Humanities Computing history! It's in very fragile condition - I've spliced it together here to give the whole piece in one image (and the blog stylesheet is not my friend here - will sort out later - but...) - enjoy!The use of computers will save the scholar years of mindless drudgery! indeed!
