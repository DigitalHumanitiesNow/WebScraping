in 2014, I organized a virtual wikipedia editathon for participants who couldn't get to an in-person one!  This year I'm doing it again, the week of March 9, although I'm delighted to say we will be holding an in person editathon on March 11!    Sign up to be added to list of participants!Video tutorials for participantsSample workflowbecause Rosie was black too, but my students had no idea!image credit wikipediaAlthough my project grew out of debates regarding the paucity of women participating in editing Wikipedia and in its content, sex is just one aspect of identity.  When I edit, I try to find entries which involve multiple marginalizations around sex, ethnicity, race, region, religion, disability, sexuality, class.WHAT:  virtual participation ( you, you and your students, you and your friends, you and the person in the office next to you, whoever wants to participate).WHEN: March 9-13,  2015 but you are free to do whatever days work for you  SIGN UP HEREWHERE: Where ever you are!  Whatever time you want to work!  That is the point of a virtual editathon, to allow people who can't make it to an in person event to participate.  I'll be sharing lots of video and web tutorials as well as ideas for incorporating into teaching. WHY:  WikiWomen's History Month   I've no idea of the true genealogy but my knowledge of feminist interventions into Wikipedia grow out of #TOOFew which is a full primer on the whys and wherefores of editing Wikipedia.HOW:  Some ideas from me to get started in very small ways (if you are doing this with students, here are my scaffolded lesson plans)De-gender womenâs pages which means not only inserting gender-neutral words, but also excising extraneous content that refers to the subjectâs sex that isnât necessary and to her familial status (wife, mother) if not related to her notability.Insert links to womenâs pages While less glamorous and fun than authoring a new article, inserting links emphasize the importance of women rather than isolating them on their own pages. Make sure to add links to womenâs pages from pages about men as well as women.Add menâs mothers. My foray into editing Wikipedia began when I realized that many famous menâs mothers and wives did not appear in their entries, while their fathers did. If family information is present in an entry, add women, mothers, wives, daughters, alongside patriarchal family references to the entries of famous men.Improve the quality of articles about women. One metric that the current study did not use is the quality of articles about women. WikiProject Womenâs History group has done an excellent job compiling these statistics. (figure 3)  Improving existing articles is not only an easier task than writing a new one, but an invaluable one in ensuring that entries about women are not deleted due to poor quality.helpful linksStart page for texted-based instructions for editing in WikipediaStart page for video-based instructions for editing in WikipediaBelow is a full walk through of Wikipedia that is useful for familiarizing yourself with the terrain!Getting startedIntroduction to WikipediaThe five pillars of WikipediaHow to edit a page and How to develop articlesHow to create your first articleSimplified Manual of StyleFor people Working with Students! The Wiki Education Foundation has many great ideas.Excellent video about Wikipedia as historyAlexandra Thom and Saisha Grayson Making History: Wikipedia Editing as Pedagogical and Public Intervention: http://My Pinterest and Wikipedia assignmentExcellent group at HASTAC about how and why you should teach with WikipediaAdeline Koh's Wikipedia AssignmentSara Humphrey's wikibook class project
