  //www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Sc47KfJjcI   	   Back before it was common practice to preface oneâs web posts with the phrase âtrigger warningâ (which, BTW, might well apply here)â¦ Before the Internetâ¦ And slightly before the public revelation of her relationship with John Lennon turnedÂ a Japanese avant-garde artist into an American household nameâ¦ Yoko Ono maintained an aura of imperviousness onstage at Carnegie Hall, as audience members accepted the challenge to cut away her clothing one piece at a time. This now-famous conceptual performance was documented by filmmakers Albert and David Maysles, who captured nervous laughter and audience commentary along with the onstage action. (Ono had previously performed the piece twice in Japan whereâwith the exception of one man who wielded theÂ scissors as if intendingÂ to stab herâaudiences proved reticent and respectful.) What does Cut PieceÂ mean? The motionlessness Ono imposed upon herself (and all subsequent performers of the work) keeps thingsÂ open to interpretation. Itâs been hailed as a deeply symbolic feminist workÂ and represented in the press of the time as an uninhibited, interactive strip show. Many an academic paper has been written. With so much control ceded to the audience, even the performer couldnâtÂ predict for certain whether the intention of the piece wouldÂ synch with the reality. Cut Piece cannot be mistaken for pure improvisation, however. Like John Cageâs 4â33â, it has a score, complete with variations: Â Cut PieceÂ  First Version for single performer:Â  Performer sits on stage with a pairÂ  of scissors placed in front of him.Â  It is announced that members of the audienceÂ  may come on stageâone atÂ  a timeâto cut a small piece of theÂ  performerâs clothing to take with them.Â  Performer remains motionlessÂ  throughout the piece.Â  Piece ends at the performerâsÂ  option. Ono has said that the impulse for Cut Piece came from the desire to create art free from ego, the âmentality of saying, âhere you are, take anything you want, any part you want,â rather than pushing something you chose on someone else.â She also took inspiration from a familiarÂ childhood story about the Buddha selflessly giving his own body to provide food forÂ a hungry tiger. It seems an apt metaphor, given the facial expressions of certain audience participants. Were they faking a confidence they didnât feel, or were they just jerks? Did I mention the trigger warning? Documentation, as any performance artist will tell you, is not quite the same as being there. Reenactments, too, may fall short of the original. Ono reprised the work in 2003, at the age of 70, noting that her motivation hadÂ shifted from rage to love, and a desire for world peace. When artist Jon Hendricks performed it in 1968, he did so in a thrift store suit, thus ignoring its creatorâs convictionÂ that part of its power came fromÂ starting outÂ in oneâs best clothes. Itâs all very ballsy, and horrifying, and compelling, and a little hard to watch. Would you consider trying it inÂ your local library, community hall, or as part of a school fundraiser?
