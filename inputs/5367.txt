Annotating is the act of expressing knowledge about a âresourceâ. A variety of web annotation tools is appearing on the scene, so how does pundit differ from others?The main idea behind Pundit is to enable users not only to comment, bookmark or tag web pages, but also to create semantically structured data while annotating, thus enriching the so called Web of Data.The ability to express semantically typed relations among resources, relying on ontologies and specific vocabularies, not only enables users to express unambiguous and precise semantics, but also, more interestingly, fosters the reuse of such collaboratively created knowledge within other web applications. For example: provide a powerful semantic search, build innovative ad-hoc data visualizations or ultimately improve the way users explore the web.This picture might give a better idea of what we mean by semantically structured annotations: the ability for users to create knowledge graphs where web content fragments, concepts and entities are meaningfully connected.Technically, such a knowledge graph is represented using the Resource Description Framework (RDF), the main building block of the so called Semantic Web.[http://www.thepund.it/introductory-videos/semantically-structured-annotations/]Pundit enables users to create semantically structured data annotating the web. Annotations are organised in notebooks which can be shared with others to create collaborative structured knowledge. They can be simple comments, semantic links to the Web of Data or fine granular cross-references and citations done between entire pages, paragraphs or any other user-defined granularity, including custom drawn shapes over images. The created data can be exploited to build custom rich visualizations, by querying the server's open API.> Quick Start Guide To Pundit[http://www.thepund.it/documentation/quick-start-guide-to-pundit/]> Introductory VideosPundit in a Nutshell [Video][http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzBm8cb-a4U]Pundit Screencast[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNyK0XAqZsM]!!!
