How Historians Read The book has always been the main method of research and communication by those interested in the humanities. However, the book as we know it is currently undergoing a dramatic change, both in format and in use. My current research examines how members of the History Department understand that change, how they feel about Ebooks and Ereaders, and how they perceive the Ebook will change the future of their classrooms. If you are a historian, or a scholar whose research relies heavily on the historical method, and you would be available on the University of Victoria campus for an interview between June 3rd and June 9th, please reply to Kim Martin at kmart5@uwo.ca. Interview information: Location: UVic Campus, specific location at your convenience Duration: Approx. 30 mins We thank you for your time and consideration, Kim Martin and Anabel Quan-Haase Faculty of Information and Media Studies University of Western Ontario Ebook Research Invitation
