Figure 1: The Pelagios 3 graph of dataThe Pelagios team had a paper entitled 'What Do You Do with a Million Links?' accepted at the Digital Classics Association organised session at the Society of Classical Studies in New Orleans this month. Sadly, none of us were able to attend in person so to make our contribution we recorded an audio ppt which you can download from the link above (it's 212MB so you'll want a reasonable internet connection). Let us know what you would do with a million links!A huge thanks to Neil Coffee and all involved for bringing the session together.
