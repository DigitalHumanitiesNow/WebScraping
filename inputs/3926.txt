On Wednesday, Dec 8, students in my writing and communication classes presented their ideas on collaborative consumption to the Georgia Tech community. Students enjoyed the challenges of communicating their proposals to students and faculty unfamiliar with the concept of collaborative consumption. Among the materials students showcased were videos, websites, and posters. See my syllabus for more information about the course. Below are some photos from the symposium. Click to view slideshow.
