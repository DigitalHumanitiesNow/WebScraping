This is my first real attempt at a developer's log. So bear with me. I've recently become an affiliate with a new center at RIT called MAGIC and, with a group of RIT folk and Ysalide Multimedia , am embarking on the development of a new game prototype. The idea is to focus on games that bring together high art and interactive media. By high art,  I mean museum objects, historic and archaeological research, as well as classic texts and literature from the humanities.  For our first project we decided to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the death of Hieronymus Bosch in 2016 and take on everybody's favorite triptych, The Garden of Earthly Delights.We've spent the last couple of weeks brainstorming and forming team subgroups. The team members are (including me):Isabelle JouveShaun FosterJesse O'BrienSteve GalbraithSarah Thompson Laura ShackelfordChris EgertDavid SimkinsElouise Oyzon Gordon Goodman Al Biles We will be bringing on a number of students to work on all aspects of game design and development.One of the things that I feel is important is in using a game to help curate an interactive experience that uses the painting, material culture and text to add to player understanding not just of the Garden of Earthly Delights, but the historical context in which Bosch made it. The steps that we will be following to create this game, in a nutsehell, are:Interpret the painting, research the history and material culture, brainstorm, identify key aspects to focus onDefine educational goals and player experience derived from #1Select mechanics and platform that support #2Break into subgroups: Educational content, Narrative, Art, Programming/Development, and Game DesignBuild:Playtest:IterateRelease prototype to the world for feedbackIterateLook for funding to build a full scale game.Part of my own personal research is to analyze games and their use of history and material culture to help us build a better type of "museum" or digital humanities game. My first effort was the Bioshock Infinite essay in this blog (also a featured post on Gamasutra).PresentationsIsabelle Jouve will be presenting the project at Museums and the Web, FlorenceProject trailer Part II: Core Themes and Educational Goals
