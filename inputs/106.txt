So, as noted yesterday, I went on Graphic Policy Radio and discussed the series of premier of Gotham, which you can listen to here:  The more serious discussion concerned how a show whose conclusion is foregone can actually survive -- after all, even though Gotham is going to focus, somewhat Wire-like, on the internal conflicts of the police and various criminal organizations, in the end we all know that the situation's going to deteriorate to the point at which the only answer is a wealthy orphan patrolling the night in a fetish bat outfit. Still, that leaves room for a good 10 or so seasons of watching the city fall apart, and that could certainly be gratifying, but only if the series creators understand what they have and how to use it. Which brings me to the second David Simon reference in this post, because I think the show's ceiling could be something likeÂ Homicide: Life on the Street. Consider how that show began, with Tim Bayliss catching the Adena Watson case, and how it haunted him through all six-ish seasons. In a similar fashion, you know the deaths of Thomas and Martha Wayne are going to haunt Gordon, and you know that he -- like Bayliss -- is going to form an unhealthy attachment to both the case and those left in its wake. Do I thinkÂ GothamÂ is going to reach these heights? In all likelihood not. But do I think that it has a higher ceiling than most quasi-procedural cop dramas currently on television? I most certainly do. On a side note, we also established the most appropriate possible context for one of those Internet traditions I started awhile back:  SO JUMP OFF THAT BUILDING YOUR THE GODDAMN BATMAN You know -- because he is.
