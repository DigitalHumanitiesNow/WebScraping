4.16.12 | at desk Jamila, one of the interns at NMAAHC just asked me for a list of my favorite websites having to do with African American history for the NMAAHC Twitter feed. I thought I would post some of the ones I like best here. I feel quite fortunate that I can spend hours lookingÂ at other people'sÂ projects–I think of them as good and necessary distractions.Â I shouldÂ mention that these sites have absorbed many hours of my time, so you are warned. Remembering Jim Crow. American Radio Works. Extraordinary databank of oral histories that you can listen to online from the Jim Crow Era. Originally a radio broadcast documentary, the producers collected stories fromÂ both black and white participants, whichÂ provides a truly different perspective. http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/remembering/index.html Â Rise and Fall of Jim Crow. PBS. A great general site about segregation, developed to accompany the PBS special, with oral histories and documents. http://www.pbs.org/wnet/jimcrow/  Â The Teenie Harris Archive. Carnegie Museum of Art. One of the problems of research is that sinceÂ we tend to preserve and celebrate the highlights and heros, Â so it can be hard to find much documentation on the lives and events of ordinary people. Teenie Harris, a photo-journalist working in Pittsburgh, documented the African American community there from 1935 to 1975, and was a pretty interesting person himself, soÂ this archive ofÂ over 80,000 images available online is particularly distracting. Â http://teenie.cmoa.org/default.aspx  Digital Harlem. Everyday Life from 1915-1930.University of Sydney. This is a very rich mapping project of Harlem with all kinds of searchable data including census, Works Progress (WPA) and police records. A fascinating approach to theÂ traditional historical mapping sites, and one that is more focused on people than places and events. http://acl.arts.usyd.edu.au/harlem/index.php  Mapping the African American Past. Columbia Teacherâs College. This is another mapping project that deals with New York. There are great documents and images (past and present) and a podcast that accompanies the individual sites. http://maap.columbia.edu/welcome
