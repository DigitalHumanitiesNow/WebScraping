As of Valentineâs Day morning 2015 â the day of its official cinema release â Sam Taylor-Johnsonâs film adaptation of the first novel in E. L. Jamesâ Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy shows a rating on the Internet Movie Database of 3.5 out of a possible 10. Over the 22853 votes that make this statistic up, 5155 (22.6%) give the maximum 10, whilst 11381 (49.8%) give the minimum 1; the 6317 vote remainder is pretty much evenly distributed amongst the other ratings, with between 2 and 4 percent of these votes going to each of the remaining available scores. It would seem from this that the film has dramatically polarised opinion, but given the fact that as of the morning of its release (a release so jealously guarded that critics werenât allowed pre-screenings and a stream of it online is practically impossible to find), this would indicate that itâs not the film itself thatâs polarised this reaction, as it is likely that it would have been unseen by most of these voters. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â The phenomenon of Fifty Shades of Grey the book â notorious for its sexual themes, clunky dialogue, and âinner goddessesâ (expunged from the film) â is what has thus obviously given rise to this a priori reaction to the film. This pre-existing polarisation has ostensibly concerned the workâs âliterary meritâ (on one side of the split, for example, are lauders of its storytelling, and its sales figures, and on the other those that have panned its writing style and believability), something which, in purely formal terms, is untranslatable between page and screen. So it is that perhaps the phenomenon itself can be analysed. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â However, the polarisation â and what underwrites it â is the first thing that needs investigation. As has been noted by many of its reviewers (in a range of lights), given its theme, the content of the film has not presented anything overly shocking for mainstream cinema (no full male nudity (whilst femaleâs of course fair game), no BDSM aspects to unsettle an audience member sat with their mum, etc.): it has by all accounts played it more safe, less âsafe-wordâ. In light of this, early reactions of filmgoers have ranged between a distaste for the âcontractâ drawn up between Grey and Anastasia in the story (which has been construed as âanti-human rightsâ) and anger from BDSM âlifestylersâ at the misrepresentation of what goes on in such a relationship by the movie, and a slew of articles concerning BDSM have been published by various outlets in the wake of the movieâs upcoming release, though few seem tied to the actual story of the film, and book, rather using it as a launch pad to talk about such sexual proclivities. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â This lack of controversy concerning the presentation of its material, however, perhaps should rather alert us to Fifty Shades of Greyâs position as that which is more normative than the discourse around its âkinksâ makes it out to be (the trilogy’s trajectory inevitably heads towards marriage in the third). The polarisation of opinion in the run-up to the filmâs release can perhaps be seen as divisiveness on the parts of those that want to defend or lambast the book, but it might therefore not indicate something truly rivening about the film itself. If it was heavily censored or banned on the back of its themes, and yet defended staunchly from other quarters, this reaction might have something more to say for the progressiveness or transgressiveness of what it deals with. As it stands, however, perhaps its ratings will come to even up between the ones and tens it so far been split between.
