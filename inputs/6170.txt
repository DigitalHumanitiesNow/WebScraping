THATCamp Liberal Arts Colleges 2012 just wrapped up at St. Edward’s University in Austin, TX. One of many GoogleDocs to emerge from the gathering was a Glossary of Digital Humanitiesâintended as a primer for newbies to DH, who might find themselves nodding and smiling in a THATCamp session, all the while furiously googling acronyms.We had fun coming up with definitions for terms from “ARIS” to “Unconference,” and hope that others will leap into the breach to add a term you’ve always found mystifying, to define a term that’s currently un- or underdefined, or to correct any mistakes you might see.
