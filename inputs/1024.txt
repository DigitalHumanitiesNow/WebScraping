What I like about this notion of the Golden Era of Visual Storytelling is that it’s seen in the here and now as being special, Â and it suggests that we might even considerÂ this period anÂ extraordinary one, even from a future perspective. That its value and worth are widely enough recognized that the energy can go into refinement and production, rather than basic awareness building. Surely the tremendous growth and maturation of infographics reflects this too. Â I think infographics are some where on this Gartner Hype Cycle, maybe on the slope of enlightenment? Â Â Or have they yet to reach that stage, and maybe are still stuck in the disillusionment trough? Visual story telling is an element of visual reasoning and visual literacy, which is grounded in spatial reasoning and spatial literacy. An idea that will one day reach its own plateau of productivity, I know. Â I tried pointing out the spatial thinking behind the visual thinking identified in the ASIDE blog, but no responses yet.
