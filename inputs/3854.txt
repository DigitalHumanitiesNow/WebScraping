You enter a theater and take your seat. The house lights dim, the curtain goes up and a dance performance by a national touring company begins to unfold. The talented dancers, stunning lighting, exquisite costumes, inspiring music and standing ovation during the final bows create an evening to remember.  	Though the beautiful memory will linger, you will likely not think of the struggles that the choreographer overcame to bring the performance to the stage.
