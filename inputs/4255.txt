Along with a previously highlighted classic Don Quixote, I was surprised to see a copy of John Milton’s Paradise Lost in the Delaware Historical Society’s rare book collection. Such a dramatic title tends to grab one’s attention. As with Aldous Huxley’s brilliant bookÂ Brave New World,Â Milton’s Paradise Lost is a book nearly everyone with any interest in literature has heard of, but one wonders how many people actually know what the book is about. Brave New World, for example, is not a congratulatory ‘pat on the back’ to modern society and its ever expanding rejection of the “old ways”, which one might assume by the title. In fact it’s the opposite; it’s an indictment of totalitarian technocracy. Â So, what is Paradise Lost about? Below are a few excerpts to give us a sense of the author, his era, and his view point on losing paradise.            About This Old Book: https://dhsbooks.wordpress.com/about-this-old-book/
