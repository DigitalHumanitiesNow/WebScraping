At the Anxious Bench, Thomas Kidd lists âFive Compelling Religious Biographies.â Among them is Catherine Brekusâs new book, Sarah Osbornâs World: The Rise of Evangelical Christianity in Early America, which Kidd calls âthe best biography we have on a female evangelical in colonial Americaâ and also âsimply one of the best books I have read on the life of an American evangelical, female or male.â
