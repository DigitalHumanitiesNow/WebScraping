 	We’re delighted to announce the immediate availability of Zotero 4.0, which offers loads of new functionality. Many of these features were requested and designed via our support forums and developer list, and we’re excited to put them into the hands of our users! Here are a few highlights: 	Automatic Journal Abbreviations Zotero now comes with built-in journal abbreviations that match publications to their standard shortened forms. 	Colored Tags Zotero 4.0 lets you to assign colors to up to six of your favorite tags to highlight important “to read” articles or other items that you would like to find quickly at a glance. 	On-Demand File Syncing The latest version of Zotero can be configured to download files only on demand to save bandwidth and disk space on devices where you don’t require your full Zotero library synchronized. A new attachment indicator UI lets you know at a glance whether a file has been synced and is available. 	 	Automatic Style Updating Zotero now performs a daily check for revised citation styles and automatically downloads them as needed. 	Detailed Download Display Our iconic one-click import just got better: Zotero now immediately shows which collection is receiving your newly saved items and indicates whether any attachments have been grabbed. 	 	Beyond these highlights, Zotero 4.0 includes many under-the-hood improvements that set the stage for major advancements in the very near future. As always, if you have any questions about Zotero, a dedicated group of users and developers are happy to help you in our support forums! 	Many thanks to Sebastian Karcher for contributing screenshots and text to this post.
