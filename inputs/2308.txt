On October 24th I will be speaking, with a host of other awesome people here: http://ucengage2014.ucop.edu/. I am quite excited to share a day with, among others,Â Daphne Koller, lead disruptor of education, and Liz Losh, lead theorizer of the productive rifts technology has provoked in education, and Eric Westervelt, whose voice I have heard on NPR for a decade. He used to be aÂ Â Middle East correspondent. Now he covers Â how technology is disrupting traditional education. Â AndÂ he thought he was leaving the hot zone… The program looks pretty great, with panels onÂ gamification, big data and student life, and mobile apps in education (a pet obsession of mine, since most learning management systems are not yet optimized for mobile devices, and that always ends up being a massive problem). Â I will be speaking about our game (which is under construction AND will be optimized for mobile devices!) as well as a series of tools I use in the online classes. See you in SF!
