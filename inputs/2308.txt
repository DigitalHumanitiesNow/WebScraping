Laura Gibbs, who teaches two purely online courses for the University of Oklahoma, most certainly qualifies as a humanities enthusiast: Dr. Gibbs, who I first met as âOnlineCrsLadyâ via Connected Courses, teaches purely online courses about mythology and folklore and epics of ancient India.Â  Dr. Gibbs blogs in Latin, translated Aesopâs Fables for Oxford University Press, and her LOLcats in Latin is probably her biggest Internet meme claim to fame. She is proudest of âa huge collection of Aesop's fables in Latin:Â âMille Fabulae et Una: 1001 Aesop's Fables in Latin.â That book, along with the other books I have written for Latin students and teachers, can be downloaded as free PDFs:Â PDF.BestLatin.net.â In other words, you canât get much more humanities than Dr. Gibbs. At the same time, sheâs digitally adept enough to aggregate her multifarious online streams with Inoreader. Gibbs doesnât lecture â at all. She does provide resources, a course aggregator, and an assignment to blog, comment, and remix. The learning, reflection, and discourse all happens on the open web, and her learners publish âStorybookâ websites in which âthey retell traditional stories in fantastic new ways.â She found, qualified, and aggregated free online mythology and folklore resources for her students, publishing an âuntextbookâ of folktales and myths, from which âeach student makes their own textbookâ from the trillions of possible combinations of tales. At DML2015, she plans to join a panel talking about student blogs and RSS. In this 10-minute video, Gibbs and I discuss teaching humanities online, public blogging in online learning, and the ways in which digital media enable e-portfolios and personal storybooks as ongoing learning instruments, which may one day replace traditional resumes.
