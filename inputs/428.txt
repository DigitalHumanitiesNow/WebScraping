It was a nice, if fairly uneventful summer (excluding a very pleasant early June trip back to the old stomping grounds in Nueba Yol, various family events, a fractured rib, and other sundries). Â I did get a fair amount of reading done, especially of the non-directly-work-related variety. Â And so, to close one door and open another, I’ve detailed the fruits of my reading-vacation below. Â What this list doesn’t include: various heaps of scholarly articles, similarly-themed books, books that I’ve forgotten, and all of the back issues of Hot Rod magazine that I managed to catch up on. Â For some of the items below, I’ve included a short, often randomly inspired comment or two. Â (Plot summaries, discussion questions, and prefabricated essays will cost you extra.) Enjoy! Â I sure did. Fiction: Seed, Rob Ziegler Â (A solid, well-written post-apocalyptic novel that bogs down a bit amidst the narrative machinery.) LoveStar, Andri Snaer Magnason (One of Â the most enjoyable reads of the summer: a deadly serious yet often hilarious, fantastic, touching, dystopic account of big data’s mastication of human life.) Galveston, Nic Pizzolatto (A worthy attempt to upgrade the hard-boiled genre.)  Master and Margarita, Mikhail Bulgakov (Oh, tovarich! Â A conversation with my life-long-ladyfriend compelled me to pick up Bulgakov’s masterpiece again, thirty years after it first ensnared me. Â Once again, the master works his magic.Â  Journey to the End of the Night, Louis-Ferdinand Celine (After knocking on the first door on Memory Lane, I felt compelled to revisit that scarier, darker house next door. Â And, as usual, I can’t believe how many new rooms and denizens I discovered on my second visit.)  Liberation: Being the Adventures of the Slick Six After the Collapse of the United States of America, Brian Slattery (The first of two Slattery novels on the list. Â Some have labeled him an acolyte of Pynchon. Â And he is, but a deviant acolyte. Â I ended up preferring this earlier novel to his latest – -see below.) Angel Baby: A Novel, Richard Lange (Another effort to upgrade the hard-boiled. Â This one slightly more successful.) American Rust: A Novel, Philipp Meyer (So, I guess his latest novel is getting some good press. Â Maybe this is the warmup act. Â Here, ambition unholstered, he takes on post-industrial working-class life. Â Kept me wondering if a certain kind of realism is really up to that task anymore.) Â  The History of Vegas, Jodi Angel West of Here, Jonathan Evison  Love Like Hate: A Novel, Linh Dinh (My colleague Isabelle Pelaud recommended this one. Â The writing is incredible, the narrative architecture fascinating, the engagement with history scary and compelling.) Battleborn, Claire Vaye Watkins (To be brief: despite a promising setting (the depleted dreamland of the American West), a disappointing first collection of short stories.) The Yellow Birds: A Novel, Kevin Powers  The Mirage, Matt Ruff (I really dug Ruff’s earlier madcap, prodigious Sewer, Gas and Electric. Â His latest is akin to Chabon’s Yiddish Policeman’s Union and Lavie Tidhar’s excellent Osama: A Novel. Â Ruff’s hyrbridizes Chanbon’s alternative history police procedural to Tidhar’s murkier alternative history nightmare.) The Coldest Night, Robert Olmstead Lost Everything, Brian Slattery (Second Slattery novel of the summer. Â Though good, this one made up in solemnity for what it lacked in verbal snap, crackle, pop. Â A bit like a mashup of the two roads – - McCarthy’s and Kerouac’s – - with a sprinkle of H.G. Wells’ WoW.)Â   This Is How You Lose Her, Junot Diaz Â (Friends seem to either love or hate the latest installment of Diaz’s reinvented Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. Â I think I prefer the earlier Drown because it’s less assured.) Tenth of December, George Saunders (The inestimable David McCormick turned me on to Saunders when he was a twinkle in the New Yorker’s eye. Â I have to admit: the earlier, more gonzo Saunders still floats my boat higher.) The Valley of the Moon, Jack London Â (Part of the continuing saga of reading every single word ever typed by Jack London. Â We all need irrational, quixotic projects. Â Don’t we?) The Assassination Bureau Ltd., Jack London (See above.)  Leviathan Wakes, James Corey (Epic sci-fi space opera prose spectacle anyone? Â Game on!) The Kings of Cool, Don WinslowÂ  California Girl, T. Jefferson Parker (Sorry. Â History repeats itself first as tragedy and then as comedy: California neo-noir continues to struggle in the shadows of giants like Chandler, Cain, Hammett, etc.)Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Zombies Exit Kingdom, Alden Bell Â (Bell’s – - aka Josh Gaylord’s – - follow-up to his first lovely zombie novel, thoroughly celebrated in one of BiB.net’s first posts. Â An excellent prequel to The Reapers Are the Angels, and Bell once again sets the standard for taking the zombie-as-literary-possibility seriously.)Â   The Last Bastion of the Living: A Futuristic Zombie Novel, Rhiannon Frater (I’m going to confess: this one and the following are Kindle reads. Â And, in most cases, Â I’ve only included the “first book” in what are usually a series of books. Â This is true pulp fiction – - both in terms of the medium and craft. Â The prose style is on par with your average eighth-grader’s book report; though usually pretty simple-minded, the plots can become quite enchantingly convoluted in pursuit of complication; the characters are more like Ikea coat stands to support action and dialogue. Â Still, taken en masse, there is a lot of cultural dreamwork here.) Â  Exodus (Extinction Point series), Paul Antony Jones Day by Day Armageddon, J. L. Bourne The Dead Years – Volume 1 (A Post-Apocalyptic Thriller),Jeff Olah Double Dead: Bad Blood, Chuck Wendig Zombie Patrol (Walking Plague Trilogy #1), J.R. Rain, Elizabeth Basque My Last Testament (Zombie Books of Survival), George Milonas Arisen, Book Two – Mogadishu of the Dead, Glynn James, Michael Stephen Fuchs (Is this the one that records the all-female Somalian assassination kick squad cavorting around the world? Â Probably not. Â But that brilliant invention is definitely buried somewhere in the zombie-themed stack of bytes on my Kindle.) The Remaining, D.J. Molles Apocalypse Z: The Beginning of the End, Manuel Loureiro (Fun, spanish rewrite of Matheson’s I Am Legend.) Poetry:  Slow Lightning, Corral, Eduardo Corral (Can you say “mindblowing”? In spanglish? Â This is soul-squeezing poetry. Â Buy it. Â Read it. Â Throw it from the top floors of skyscrapers. Â Feed it to your children with milk and vinegar. Â Etc.) Non-fiction: The Problem with Work: Feminism, Marxism, Antiwork Politics, and Postwork Imaginaries, Kathi Weeks (An American political scientist takes Italy’s autonomist marxist heritage seriously. Â The prose remains trapped in American political science – - but the re-reading of the autonomists proves fertile.) To Save Everything, Click Here: The Folly of Technological Solutionism, Evgeny Morozov (A notch above the usual “Overthrow the digital overlords!” rant.)  Whitey Bulger: America’s Most Wanted Gangster and the Manhunt That Brought Him to Justice, Kevin Cullen, Shelley Murphy (Who could resist reading this as Boston’s favorite Cain stood before justice? Â No charges of over-complicating things here. Â By-the-numbers journo account of Bulger’s bloody wake.) The Purple Decades: A Reader, Tom Wolfe Â (I’m trying so hard to appreciate Wolfe’s “new” journalism. Â I am. Â Really.) Punk Rock: An Oral History, John Robb, Lars Fredriksen  Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth Hardcover, Reza Aslan Â (The religion prof takes down one of Fox News’ talking heads on-air. Â Professional courtesy demands that I buy and read the book.) Networked: The New Social Operating System by Lee Rainie and Barry Wellman Immaterial Labor, Precarity, and Recomposition, Edna Brophy and Greig de Peuter  The Immaterial: knowledge, value and capital, Andre Gorz (One of Gorz’s final books and evidence of the unstoppable power of human intellect. Â Period.) Cheever: A Life, Blake Bailey A Thousand Machines, Gerald Raunig Monsters of the Market: Zombies, Vampires and Global Capitalism, David McNally (The current popular zombie fixation holds the key to unlocking the deep, dark secrets of our enthrallment to capitalist domination. Â Yes, some days, I’m almost sure. Â Dave McNally’s book offers qualified support for my misty intuition.) Â   All for a Few Perfect Waves: The Audacious Life and Legend of Rebel Surfer Miki Dora, David Rensin (The quintessential SoCal surf rat and prototype for future punks everywhere. Â A surprisingly good and rich bio of Da Cat.) Voodoo Wave: Inside a Season of Triumph and Tumult at Maverickâs, Mark Kreidler
