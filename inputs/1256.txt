One thing that stands out to me is the fact that, even though 35,000 fewer votes were cast for Lieutenant Governor than for Governor, there were double the number of write-in votes for Lieutenant Governor than for Governors (As of 1:36pm, 11/10, 3816 write-in votes for Lieutenant Governor versus 1729 for Governor.) See the results. Any thoughts about why this might have occurred? Perhaps more people were generally dissatisfied with the candidates on the ballot?
