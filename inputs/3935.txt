My article “DHTML Dances: The Making of an E-Poet” is now available online in the most recent issue (co-edited by Monika GÃ³rska OlesiÅska and Anna Nacher) of the Polish peer-reviewed journal Cultural Studies Review. Here’s the abstract: Canadian poet, programmer, and artist Jim Andrews lived and worked in Seattle 1997â2000, participating in the exuberant economic and technological growth known as the dot-com era. Andrewsâ DHTML poems engage the materiality of Web technologies from this moment in computational history and were instrumental in his formation as a poet. This article performs media-specific analyses on Enigma n and Seattle Drift to contextualize and demonstrate Andrewsâ evolution into an e-poet. Here’s a link to the article, which is not open access, unfortunately. Fortunately, it only costs 3,99zÅ (which is about $1.07 USD) to purchase. You might even want to pay 14,00zÅ for the whole issue ($3.77 USD!) and get access to the whole collection of scholarly articles on electronic literature. Here are the keywords for the issue.
