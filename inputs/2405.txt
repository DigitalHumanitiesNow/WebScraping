On Thursday, February 27th, 2014, I traveled to Yale to speak about the uses of data visualization, past and present. Trip Kirkpatrick, of the Instructional Technology Group, wrote upÂ a great summary of my talkÂ on the DH Working Group website. (My slides are embedded in that post). I’m hoping to write up a more formal version of my remarks soon.
