I shall discuss the Son of Suda On Line (SoSOL), a proposed web-based, fully         audited, version-controlled editing environment being built for the papyrological community but designed         for applicability to other editing communities. It will enable the collaborative editing of texts in a framework         of rigorous and transparent peer-review and credit mechanisms and strong editorial oversight.
