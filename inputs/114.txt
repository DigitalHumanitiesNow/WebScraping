I believe if you start readingÂ hereÂ youâll be able to see exactly what Iâve been dealing with tonightâ¦but thatâs not why Iâm writing this. Iâm writing this because some people â who can not be proven to be the people involved in that conversation â are threatening to tell my employers thatÂ Iâve been accused of sexual harassmentÂ and am therefore an enemy to âtrue feministsâ and âfeminismâ everywhere. Theyâre also claiming thatÂ I failed to act appropriatelyÂ in another awful incident and this, I admit, is why Iâm angry enough to write this post. All of which tells me everything I need to know about them who would doxx me â I say let âem, as I know yâall remember things Iâve done that are far worse or more impolitic. Right?
