So Steven Soderbergh posted this cool little rumination about the powerful clarity of shot selection/juxtaposition inÂ Raiders of the Lost Ark. Â In it, he talks about how he forces himself to really look at films he admires in order to understand them more deeply. Â To facilitate that withÂ Raiders, he’s removed the audio, replaced it with a contemplative track, and removed the color. It’s a great way to get inside a work. Â It also reminds me of the fabled, blink-and-you-missed it Topher Grace recut of theÂ Star Wars prequels. Again, it’s about taking something apart to see how it works, putting it back together in a different way to see where its possibilities lie. Â Good stuff, both.
