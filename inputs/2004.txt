The Hellespont Project aims to integrate two of the largest online collections for the study of Antiquity, the Perseus Digital Library and the Arachne archaeological database, in a dynamic digital research environment. Our case study is focused on a limited historical period, the 50 years in the history of Athens between the Persian Wars and the outburst of the Peloponnesian War (431 BCE), following the narration presented by Thucydides (1.89-118). Our goal is to create a “digital sourcebook” where the different sources (texts and images) are linked and enriched with linguistic, archaeological and historical annotation.
