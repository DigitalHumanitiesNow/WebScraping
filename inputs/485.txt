Biblicum Jassyense: Romanian Journal for Biblical Philology and HermeneuticsISSN: 2068-7664"Biblicum Jassyense" is an annually peer reviewed international journal.  Its aim is to reflect, from a neutral point of view, the philological  debates that animate the domain of the Romanian and South-East European  traditions of the Bible in the European context. We are also paying  attention to the history of literarure and the history of religions,  research that have as starting point the canonical or apocryphal  religious texts from the proximity of the biblical tradition. In the  studies, discussion notes and reviews sections we are hosting debates  that approach such wider interest areas, but always have as starting  point precise philological and hermeneutical applications.
