It’s not, though: it’s a community baby! Nothing would give me more pleasure than to keep improving the THATCamp website, starting and maintaining initiatives like the Code of Conduct and the Proceedings, answering questions on the forums, and in general to keep helping humanities scholars and technologists learn and build together in the world’s best humanities and technology unconference.Jeffrey McClurkenFrom the first THATCamp at RRCHNM, I have been energized by the format, the opportunity to talk, create, and build with other digitally inclined people, and the chance to introduce new people to the digital humanities. I’ve attended a dozen THATCamps, run numerous bootcamps/workshops, and helped to organize four THATCamps (2 iterations of THATCamp AHA and 2 of THATCamp Virginia).  Over the last year, Iâve enjoyed my time on THATCamp Council where my goal continues to be to support the open, non-hierarchical, inclusive, productive spirit that has infused THATCamp for so many.Kathryn TomasekAs an analog historian who came into DH midway through my academic career, I had access to the international DH community through programs focused on teaching with TEI and through presenting at annual DH conferences beginning in 2010. THATCamp has offered me significant opportunities to connect with U.S. historians who are engaged with the broad Digital Humanities community, both international and domestic. I have attended numerous THATCamps focused on pedagogy, organized regionally, and connected to disciplinary conferences. I’ve also been to THATCamp Prime, and I organized THATCamp AHA 2014.Overall, THATCamp includes some of the elements of DH that appeal to me most: interdisciplinarity, collaboration, generosity, accessibility. I have attended THATCamps in which “feral cats” have broken off into their own sessions to emphasize the importance of hacking over yakking as well as ones that included workshops on topics like an introduction R Studio. I have appreciated the way the (oxymoronic) unconference structure fosters talk across the artificial divisions of academic disciplines and institutions. Given the number of THATCamps I have attended, I also wonder whether the experience has become a bit stale, and I’m interested in seeing how THATCamp can evolve over the next several years.My professional interests include broadening definitions of what “counts” as scholarship and resisting hierarchies that separate tenured/tenure-track faculty interests from those of adjuncts, alt-ac, GLAM, and public historians. I am a member of the American Historical Association’s ad hoc Committee on the Professional Evaluation of Digital Scholarship by Historians. I am particularly interested in what historians, other academics, and alt-ac folks in the U.S. can learn from our colleagues around the world. I’m particularly pleased that the THATCamp Council Charter includes nation among the diversities of membership it encourages.Tim SherrattTHATCamp changed my life. In 2010 I was on the other end of Twitter, enviously following THATCamps half a world away, when someone asked, ‘Why not organise your own?’ And so THATCamp Canberra, Australia’s first THATCamp, was born. At the time there was no DH association in Australia and I remember one excited Canberra camper telling me ‘I’ve found my people!’. I knew exactly what she meant. The sense of community and collaboration is still the thing I value most about the THATCamp experience.I’ve organised a couple more THATCamps since 2010, and have camped in a variety of other cities and countries. I guess I’m addicted. I want the THATCamp movement to continue to grow and evolve and I’d like to help that happen by serving on the Council. I’m particularly interested in promoting DH within the cultural heritage sector. My working life reflects this, split between the management of Trove at the National Library of Australia and my new role as Associate Professor of Digital Heritage at the University of Canberra. As well as adding a bit more geographic diversity to the Council, I’m hoping I can I can throw some additional perspectives into the mix. I’m @wragge on Twitter and blog at discontents.com.au.William WendI am a lecturer at Burlington County College in Pemberton NJ. I helped run THATCamp Jersey Shore in 2011 and have coordinated THATCamp Community College the past two years. I want to be on THATCamp council so I can further help grow the THATCamp community. I will bring a community college perspective to the council and experience from K-12 as well. I have seen the interconnection of technology and the humanities at levels ranging from 6th grade to private universities, so I feel I offer a valuable perspective.This poll is closed!
