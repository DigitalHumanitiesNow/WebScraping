I am delighted to announce that later this semester, I will be joining the faculty of the Purdue University Libraries as an associate professor. At Purdue, I will focus on emerging technologies in education with a special focus on the first year experience. If you don’t already know about the great work happening in educational technologies at Purdue, I’d recommend checking out their ITaP studio where they’ve developed learning tools that include: an app that integrates with Facebook to increase student engagement, a learning analytics platform, and a badging system. I’ll also continue my current line of research and look forward to the expansive new lines of inquiry I’ll pursue in collaboration with my new Purdue colleagues.
