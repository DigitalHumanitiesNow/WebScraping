I’m not female, and I’ve spent little time in the “workplace” or balancing work and life, so I don’t feel very qualified to speak about the conversation that’s taking place involving the current state of feminism. However, I really enjoyed this piece from Catherine Rottenberg, especially the following paragraph: This, unfortunately, is how the “truly liberated” woman of the 21st century is increasingly being construed.Â What is particularly troubling about this feminist moment – especially since both women espouse liberal ideals – is exactly how little emphasis either Slaughter or Sandberg ultimately places on equal rights, justice or emancipationÂ as the end goalsÂ for feminism.
