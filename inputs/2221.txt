Great story of nerdiness and discovery and friendship, focusing on the author’s adult memories of his love for a particular text adventure game at a crucial phase of his youth. I’ve collected several such stories in “Interactive Fiction Reflection and Nostalgia.” He knew the game, practically had it memorized. He would be the computer. I would be the player. We sat down at the table in my family room. The name of the game was Adventure. âYouâre at the end of a road. Thereâs a building in the distance.â And with a simple sentence or two, we were off and running. I would listen to Bennyâs descriptions and then suggest a direction or an action. He would then provide me with the next description or obstacle or puzzle. Almost immediately, I was hooked. Time and distance might be exaggerating the memory in my mind, but it seems to me that we stayed up until well past midnight. I donât know how far along I got in my inaugural exploration of the cave. I recall the hollow voice saying âPlughâ so I know I at least made it to Y2 on that first outing. via Adventure | T.M.
