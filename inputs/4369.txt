Much interest in Universal Acceptance at ICANN‘s recent meeting in Singapore. Universal Acceptance means getting all domain names to work, however long they are and whatever script they’re in. Traditionally most Top Level Domains have been ASCII three digit if generic names (e.g. .com) and two digit if country codes (e.g. .uk). Now more or less anything goes and there will be extensions such as .versicherung and .ì¼ì± (Samsung). And so the title of this article could be an email address: Chris.Dillon@handphone.Samsung. “Handphone” is Konglish (Korean English) for “mobile phone”. Incidentally, if your browser does not display the hangul in this article correctly, you have a Universal Acceptance issue.
