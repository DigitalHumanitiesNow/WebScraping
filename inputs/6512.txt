UPDATE: We are offering $1,000 of books to the person who finds us a library developer. Code! Code! Code!  LibraryThing, the company behind LibraryThing.com and LibraryThing for Libraries, is looking to hire a top-notch developer/programmer. We like to think we make “products that don’t suck,” as opposed to much of what’s developed for libraries. We’ve got new ideas and not enough developers to make them. That’s where you come in. The Best Person Work for us in Maine, or telecommute in your pajamas. We want the best person available. If you’re junior, this is a “junior” position. If you’re senior, a “senior” one. Salary is based on your skills and experience. Technical Skills LibraryThing is mostly non-OO PHP. You need to be a solid PHP programmer or show us you can become one quickly. You should be experienced in HTML, JavaScript, CSS and SQL. We welcome experience with design and UX, Python, Solr, and mobile development.  The highly-photogenic LibraryThing staff only use stock photos ironically.  What We Value Execution is paramount. You must be a sure-footed and rapid coder, capable of taking on jobs and finishing them with attentionÂ and expedition. Creativity, diligence, optimism, and outspokenness are important. Experience with library data and systems is favored. LibraryThing is an informal, high-pressure and high-energy environment. This puts a premium on speed and reliability, communication and responsibility. Working remotely gives you freedom, but also requires discipline and internal motivation. Compensation Gold-plated health insurance. Cheese. How To Apply We have a simple quiz, developed back in 2011. If you can do it in under five minutes, you should apply for the job! If not, well, wasn’t that fun anyway? To apply, send a resume. Skip the cover letter, and go through the blog post in your email, responding to the tangibles and intangibles bullet-by-bullet. Also include your solution to the quiz, and how long it took you. Anything under five minutes is fine. If it takes you longer than five minutes, we wonât know. But the interview will involve lots of live coding. Feel free to send questions to tim@librarything.com, or Skype chat Tim at LibraryThingTim. Please put “Library developer” somewhere in your email subject line.
