This talk aims at discussing a model for digital scholarly editions of texts with a multi-testimonial textual tradition where, for each witness, two layers of digital representation are formally and explicitly distinct, though interrelated: A. The graphical representation of the text of that witness, mirroring its specific encoding system (alphabet, capitalisation, punctuation, word boundaries, scribal abbreviations, page space arrangement etc.); B. The text of that witness in an 'uniform' digital encoding, necessary to make the representations of the text of different witnesses digitally comparable. The talk will also explore how TEI P5 can address the theoretical modelling issues involved.
