Ancient documentary scholars face a range of challenges in obtaining accurate         physical documentation to support both decipherment and study of the processes of writing. In this         seminar we present results from a joint Southampton-Oxford AHRC-funded project designed to address         these issues through the application of Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) technologies.         Through case studies of Egyptian and Classical material captured using a custom lighting-dome system         and highlight-based RTI, we demonstrate how RTI is able to overcome challenges of image lighting as         well as providing a more reflexive environment for observation and processes of ‘looking at’ inscribed         surfaces..
