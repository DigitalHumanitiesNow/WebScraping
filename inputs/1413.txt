 Last week I was in sunny rainy Charleston, SC attending the National States Geographic Information Councilâs annual meeting. NSGICâs mission is to promote coordination of geospatial activities within and between states and to advocate for effective policy at the national level. I made many connections within the amazing community of professionals who represent 36 states at the conference. It is of no surprise that these states share so many common challenges. The bedrock of their data, things like road centerlines, address points, parcels and boundaries are all seeing increasing demands for use. Those who use the data need it to be absolutely accurate as there is little margin for error in domains like emergency response. How do the data owners allow, for example, a 911 call-center operator who finds a problem with an address to log an error that can be easily acted upon right at that data point? Or, how can they allow that person or a citizen stakeholder to propose a correction or addition to the data while maintaining its authoritative nature? The challenge of collaboration around authoritative data is one that we think about a lot on the Open Data team. Today we enable information to be shared within organizations and governments as well as with the general public. For example, the State of Wyoming uses ArcGIS Open Data to publish theirÂ highway network dataset. However, there is so much room to grow in order for Open Data to help complete the circle of publishing, feedback and improvement. I know that the whole Open Data team is excited to tackle this challenge as we continue to conduct research and develop our product. And, personally, I’m looking forward to catching up with all the states again in Annapolis. Daniel Fenton is a Product Engineer on the Open Data Team
