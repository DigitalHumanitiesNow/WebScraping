After trying several different methods, I've finally found a good solution for the photo album for GMU's Center for Global Education. A small list of available albums is on the Center's album page. More pictures will be up in the near future but, in the meantime, I'd love some feedback on what people think about its organization and usability.   *[GMU]: George Mason University
