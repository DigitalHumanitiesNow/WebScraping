 I am very excited to announce the launch ofÂ Zulus on Display! When I first returned to CHI this year, I planned to expand my project from the 2013-2014 fellowship, Imbiza: A Digital Repository of the 2010 World CupÂ (you can read more about that project hereÂ and here). Â One of the main parts of Imbiza that I was hoping to expand upon was the geospatial visualizations that I built for version 1.0 that I had left out in the interest of time. Â This, however, presented me with a problem that I had been dealing with since I first conceptualized Imbiza in late 2013. Â Soccer is not the focus of my research. Â I am a big soccer fan and I enjoy reading, writing, and teaching about the subject, when it comes right down to it, it’s a very strong side interest. Â I am a historian of Zulu life and culture, especially the construction of and deployment of Zulu masculinity as an international trope. Â While, in a way, this is connected to a project on soccer, during the course of Imbiza I had found myself doing a lot of work that took time away from my personal research. Â So embarking on another year-long project delving with an academic interest, but not my main research focus was something that I was hesitant to approach. I spoke with Ethan Watrall, our CHI director, about this earlier this year and he encouraged me to pursue a project that was more in tune with my research; in short, he told me that I should do a project that would help me prepare for my dissertation, instead of distracting me from it. Â That’s when I thought about this project. Â Since the mid-1850s, Europeans and Americans have been seemingly obsessed with what Jabulani Sithole has referred to using the idiom ubuZulu bethu (literally, “our Zuluness.” Â But their fascination was not with “our Zuluness” but rather with “their” Zuluness, the Zulu ethnicity that could be packaged, displayed, and sold for a profit. Â This project explores instances of Zulus and Zuluness being used as entertainment, as a commodity to be sold for a profit. Â But this project also shows that this was not a one-way exchange, but rather a process that involved negotiation and adaptation by a variety of groups for a variety of different reasons. Zulus on Display was built using a Twitter BoostrapÂ framework, with a modified theme from Start Boostrap. Â The map was built usingStoryMapJS. Â Incorporating open access historical photographs, documents, newspaper clippings, and videos, this geospatial timeline allowsÂ for an exploration of the temporal and spatial components of this historical phenomenon while also providing a forum to explore broader themes embodied in the displaying of “Zulu” bodies as entertainment. Â All of the photos and videos included in the map are openly available from various insitutions that can be linked from the citations under each photo. Â You can access all of the files used to build this site on Github. Â Below you can watch a presentation on this project that I presented at a LOCUS talk at Michigan State University in February 2015.
