Gregory Crane Perseus Project and the Open Philology Project The University of Leipzig and Tufts University The Department of Classics at Tufts University is looking at candidates for a tenure track assistant professor who works on Greco-Roman and Islamic Cultures.

This position can do a lot more now if it properly exploits digital media and helps to change the public understanding of what we in Europe and North America already owe to the achievements of Islamic culture.
