This weekend I wrote omekaR, an API client for Omeka in R. (Yes, I had earlier written an Omeka API client in Ruby. But since the main reason that I would want to access an Omeka site is to do some kind of data analysis, R is a much more suitable language.) The client is very bare bones at the moment, but it can get any kind of resource, fetch all items, and extract metadata from items in a way that is idiomatic to R. I will likely finish the client when I write the section on APIs for Digital History Methods in R.
