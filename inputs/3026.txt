I write in bits and pieces. I expect most writersÂ do.Â I think of things at the oddest moments.Â I surf the web and find a document that fits into a writing project. I have an email dialog and know it belongs with my essay. It is almost never a good time to write so I file everything.Â Evernote is an excellent tool for aggregating all of the bits in notebooks.Â I have every intention of getting back to them. Unfortunately, once the content is filed, it usually stays buried and forgotten. I need a way to keep my content alive. The solution is a daily email, a link to a random Evernote note. I canÂ read the note to keep it fresh in memory. I can edit the note, even just one change to keep it growing. I looked around for a service but could not find one. I did find an IFTTT recipe for emailing a daily link to a random Wikipedia page. IFTTT sends the daily link to a Wikipedia page that automatically generates a random entry. In the end, I had to build an Evernote page to do aÂ similarÂ thing. You can set up Evernote Random too, but you need a few things. An Evernote account, obviously. A web host that supports PHP. A bit of technical skill. I have already written the Evernote script that generates the random link. But you have to walk through some technical Evernote setup steps, like generating keys and testing your script in their sandbox. The Evernote Random script. It has all the instructions. An IFTTT recipe. That’s the easy part. Take the script. Improve it. Share it. Sell it. Whatever you like. I would enjoy hearing about it.
