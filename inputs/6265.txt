Thanks to the brilliant artwork of Kelly Goeller (http://kellotron.com ) and the designer at the press, The Emergence of the Digital Humanities now has a cover design! As I posted earlier, for me nothing captures the perceived eversion of the digital into the physical better than this iconic piece, Pixel Pour, and especially since its own history and construction as a work of street art reminds us of the ineluctable materialities of both digital and physical in the world around us.
