What may seem like a long hiatus, has actually been filled with more productivity than can quite be captured in a blog post. I’ve settled into my new(ish) position as a postdoctoral Fellow in Women’s, Gender & Sexuality Studies and the NU Lab for Digital Humanities at Northeastern. I am having a fantastic time. I’ll be documenting my goings on via blog post to the NU Lab Website. Here’s a link to my first entry. Enjoy!
