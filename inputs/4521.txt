Today we finished posting all 20 of contributors’ revised chapters plus an entirely new section titled, “Conclusions: What We Learned from Writing History in the Digital Age” (co-authored with Charlotte D. Rochez and Timothy Burke). We welcome your comments and reflections on our synthesis of the open-peer review process and online writing experience.   In addition, we also submitted the full manuscript to the University of Michigan Press, and will keep you informed about their editorial board decision-making process. We refer to this as the “Spring 2012 version” (yes, we’re a bit behind schedule, but we beat the summer solstice!) and it consists of a total of 99,489 words and 14 illustrations, which will serve as the “print version” if the Press accepts it. We’re still working out the best way to maintain and archive the “full digital version” with all illustrations, drafts, and commentary, which is available to read on our site.  If you or any of your colleagues are considering assigning readings from our open-access web-book to students next academic year, please tell us more by posting a comment here.   -Jack Dougherty and Kristen Nawrotzki, co-editors Writing History in the Digital Age
