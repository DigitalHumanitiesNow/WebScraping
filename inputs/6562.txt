We salute Corporal George Wesley Heinel, Sergeant Warren Ridgway Baldwin, and Private Frank Balling today. The Sunday Star indicates unrest in Portugal and runs a story concerning the U.S. Navy and its readiness for combat should the need arise.                 For more soldiers from Delaware and Sunday Star clips, see past posts of Remembering WWI in Delaware Â https://dhsbookswwi.wordpress.com
