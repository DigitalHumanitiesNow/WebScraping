by Eric  Ever wondered what companies are taking up the most space in San Francisco? Kalin Kelly, a director at boutique real estate firm CM Commercial, has been wondering the same thing and decided to take action to find out.    Over the past few months, sheâs been collecting all of the data she can find about leasing transactions in San Francisco. What sheâs found is that the biggest real estate deals happening in the city (in terms of space) are mainly being done with technology companies, and that the lionâs share of it is happening along Market Street and into the Mission and Dogpatch. She predicts that the trend will continue south into the Mission.  Is her prediction correct? Only time will tell. In the meantime, take a look at the map and see for yourself and read more about it in TechCrunch.   Stamen founder and creative director Eric Rodenbeck has worked with Kalin Kelly as part of his work with the Community Arts Stabilization Trust (CAST).
