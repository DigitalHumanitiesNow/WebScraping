 @GeorgeOnline Aw shucks. But the class of 2004 (those bloggers) led the way. in reply to GeorgeOnline # @GeorgeOnline DOH! in reply to GeorgeOnline # Unfortunately, no one who *didn't* go to #mla09 added to newest @ProfHacker post on why Twitter matters. Fixed that: http://bit.ly/7hnKHx. # @ryancordell It was never a contest. Hats off to the king! in reply to ryancordell # New at @ProfHacker: "Academics and Social Media: #mla09 and Twitter," by @GeorgeOnline: http://wp.me/pAGUw-19K # @mlaconvention Thanks for the link! I didn't know this was here. in reply to mlaconvention # Now I'm prepping for an interview with a reporter from the Greenville News about contingent faculty. The #MLA09 ride continues! # @erinsells I'm about 100 steps from it. Want me to break in? in reply to erinsells # My newest post at @ProfHacker tackles a problem I've recently faced, "Shifting the Days of Your Syllabus": http://bit.ly/4GDrk0. # Prepping before a phone interview as part of a post-doc. #jobmarket # Wow. A Community College job, but it's in Key West… #jobmarket # Okay. Post scheduled. Took 12 minutes longer than I'd hoped. Need to get faster at this still. # @triproftri I don't know. But we should form a pact not to send any students to grad school. Poor devils. in reply to triproftri # @triproftri Which is why repyament should also be pegged to cost of living in people's areas. After all, TT Eng profs don't make tons. in reply to triproftri # I'm giving myself one hour maximum to write this afternoon's @ProfHacker post. Let's see if I can do it. # @triproftri Well, right now I pay nothing. Although I'd prefer to not make what I do now for the rest of my life. in reply to triproftri # @academicdave Not saying your idea is wrong though. The problem is also that many of best grad schools are in expensive places to live. in reply to academicdave # @academicdave Emory was nice. I had two years where I didn't have any thing to do. And I got stipend too. in reply to academicdave # @academicdave My PhD *was* free. It was just eating and living someplace that I couldn't afford. in reply to academicdave # @triproftri The new IBR program will erase debt after 25 years of repayment. http://bit.ly/8G04Zv in reply to triproftri # Diff btw housing bubble & studnt loans: law doesn't let one drop loans if education has less value than purchase price. http://bit.ly/7X2TJP # Oh and that's with well less than 1 inch of snow. I *so* live in the South. # All schools closed. public buildings not opening until noon. #damnweathersissies # @digitalhumanist Right. But it's percentage read, right rather than page numbers, since you can change text size? Small quibble, I know. in reply to digitalhumanist # RT @dancohen: Transcript of my talk "Is Google Good for History?" for those following #AHA2010 online: http://bit.ly/8qn90g # @captain_primate Georgia's expecting less than an inch today–if that–and they closed schools ahead of any clouds forming. in reply to captain_primate # @digitalhumanist I just have a hard time with losing the page numbers of what I'm reading. Feels wrong somehow. in reply to digitalhumanist # @wpwend42 Make sure you see the final version. There's a bit less to it than the one that I linked to then. in reply to wpwend42 # @wpwend42 Or rather this semester is 75 minutes. I assumed you were reading syllabi for this one. # @clioweb 11th grade Eng teacher made me read all of Moby Dick and write @ each chap over winter holidays. Still hate the book due to that. # If you #mla09 (like me) read this piece on Cathy Porter's translation initiative. http://tinyurl.com/ygf5nak (via @mlaconvention) # And now I'm off to meet with a Dean about the two students who plagiarized last semester. # Apparently I put spring break on my survey syllabus 2x: once as days off and once with readings. Not looking forward to cutting more of it. # @mlaconvention I spend the last 7 minutes on syllabus. The other 68 were spent diving in. And it's my favorite way. Get hands dirty quick. in reply to mlaconvention # @mlaconvention Too much talking. It's syllabus day, & I have to more or less run everything on those days. 4 classes later, the jaw is sore. in reply to mlaconvention # I can't believe my jaw hurts this much after only 4 weeks of not having classes. # yes. totally # Getting a jump on my survey students by starting them off with Dickinson. # O hai, commute. Haven't seen you for a while. No. I didn't miss you either. # @billwolff I think you're thinking of Nicholas Carr. As I did at first. in reply to billwolff # RT @mlaconvention: "Why Twitter Will Endure," from the NY Times: http://bit.ly/6feETg # @amandafrench I thought the same thing re: Nicholas Carr. in reply to amandafrench # @samplereality @dancohen It has to be #AHA2010 so the historians of the AHA don't get these tweets confused with those of #AHA1910. # @jbj Maybe *you're* being weird for posting to the MLA forums. <small font>maybe</small font> in reply to jbj # @betajames Glad to see you back, Sir. You are definitely not me. in reply to betajames # @eetempleton That's probably right. I knew how the classes gelled last semester. This semester I'm not sure yet. in reply to eetempleton # @betajames Hmm. Are you me? in reply to betajames # @eetempleton I'm wondering if it's related to these being modded versions of classes I taught before. Nervous I won't do as well? in reply to eetempleton # @seabright I grab photos from Facebook for the few students that don't have pics in the Clemson system. You could do same. in reply to seabright # @betajames You mean you're not a cartoon in real life? in reply to betajames # @seabright I don't really use it that way. But I plug photos into the Attendance app on my iPod, which makes roll taking a snap. in reply to seabright # Clemson gives us photo rolls of students. But photos come from IDs, taken when they're freshmen. They're seldom accurate. (But fun.) # Trying to get ready for first day of classes tomorrow. Feeling (inexplicably) the tiniest bit nervous. Not sure why. Post-break jitters? # @loriemerson Surveys *do* tend toward men, however. Shakespeare's sister problem again. in reply to loriemerson # @loriemerson The modernism section is guy-heavy. But I try to make up for that in the postmodern section. in reply to loriemerson # @seabright Oh, I know *Boxer* backwards and forwards. And it is great. Trying to get an appreciation of this one though. in reply to seabright # And now it's time for The National's *Alligator*. Perhaps only my second listen. #music # @BenRobertson Who cares? Historians are at #5 and philosopher at #11. Problem solved! in reply to BenRobertson # Listening to The Most Serene Republic for the first time–despite owning three of their albums for more than 2 years. #music #collectingprob # @parezcoydigo Why don't you have *me* read it! in reply to parezcoydigo # I'll be interested to see if #AHA10 can hold a candle to #MLA09. # Lunch. I definitely need lunch. # RT @markgammon: Interesting read: Google's biggest announcement was not a phone, but a URL http://bit.ly/4WdPuL (@NYTimes) # @dougreside Not only a surface but also a @digitalhumanist, by the looks of things! in reply to dougreside # @finnarne Maybe they're not remixes but "edits"? http://bit.ly/5Dz8lH I have first 3 tracks. in reply to finnarne # Listening to @twittledragon's Machine Dreams. And trying to figure out what I think. Am embarrassed to admit knowing they're Swedish helps. # @brettbobley The problem with that approach is that the iPhone can't download the pizza's pictures wirelessly. in reply to brettbobley # @bitchphd Saw that one coming. Ducked. in reply to bitchphd # @erinsells @bitchphd Just cut me some Philip Roth out of the syllabus. # @tanyaclement Yes. Yes, you can. in reply to tanyaclement # @tanyaclement You should see @nowviskie and @joegilbert's ghetto, DIY Surface at Scholars' Lab in reply to tanyaclement # @roopikarisam No. Do it. Love, the College. in reply to roopikarisam # Getting help from a close friend in whittling down the last few changes to my syllabus. #classprep # @finnarne I only have the 3 original tracks. How are the remixes? (I'm generally skeptical of remixes). in reply to finnarne # I think this library has entered into a pact with local coffee ships to freeze me out. # Listening to Lindstrom's *Where You Go I Go Too* for the first time. #music # The interface on http://www.scribblemaps.com seems a little easier than basic Google maps for annotations. # @samplereality I see what you're going for. But I prefer @Pierre_Menard_'s version: http://bit.ly/53o7ZL. in reply to samplereality # I very much like @academicdave's new post on #mla09 and the non-rise of the Digital Humanities: http://bit.ly/7AmME2. # @jenterysayers Can I say "Death of a Salesman"? in reply to jenterysayers # Just reading yesterday's IHE piece on #mla09's @mlatweetup: http://bit.ly/8VnwQt. Ft. @ryancordell, @mkirschenbaum, & @kfitz in comments. # @ryancordell Congrats! Glad there are positions for innovators. # @karikraus Or is just that the MLS has changed a lot in the lat 10 years? in reply to karikraus # @nowviskie As opposed to what it is now, which is *supposed* to be on-the-job training. But the jobs have vanished. in reply to nowviskie # @williamjturkel I tell all of my students that they should absolutely not go. Most of them don't believe me. # @karikraus The problem is that *you* know the difficulty of the profession now. Hard to think that way as an undergrad. in reply to karikraus # @dav2b WOOT! Thanks for this! in reply to dav2b # @DrewBrittain Ah. I've obviously progressed beyond the point of clarity. We're reading a small portion of Fear and Loathing. 2 pages or so. in reply to DrewBrittain # @derekbruff @academicdave I do sometime wish I'd gone with a shorter online name, but decision was made pre-Twitter. in reply to derekbruff # @derekbruff @markgammon It's true re: my one-name-to-rule-them-all decision. But I, like @academicdave, put my Twit avatar on badges too. in reply to derekbruff # Thinking that all of my sites need a color face-lift. Will have to have Kuler take care of that for me shortly. # @ryancordell You def. need both.They need to see you do some close reading and some theorizing.Remember that you're TEACHING, not lecturing. in reply to ryancordell # @DrewBrittain It gets other toys, including Twitter. #eng465 in reply to DrewBrittain # @DrewBrittain Thompson? I can't think of an author with that name that I'm teaching. You've baffled me. 465 doesn't have a timeline. in reply to DrewBrittain # Ignoring the final changes to my syllabus for the moment in favor of getting the timeline started. Will include geotagging this time. # Job: Sr Prog Officer, Digital Library Found, Council on Lib & Info Resources. In DC http://bit.ly/7hh3VP  (via @jasonrhody, @mkimarnold) # @chutry Hi from Clemson! Along with Twitter, my students will be experimenting with Google Wave this semester. in reply to chutry # @billwolff I like, but the problem is that I have only 2 days for the poetry at the moment. in reply to billwolff # @erinsells I'd like to see that when you're done. in reply to erinsells # @roo_bee You always tweet! in reply to roo_bee # @billwolff I meant to add him since last year I spoke about his work repeatedly as example of "shoring up fragments."But not seeming to work in reply to billwolff # @billwolff Pound works well with the phrase "Make it new" and w/reading YHCHI's Dakota. Eliot is a lot in one day w/others. in reply to billwolff # Amazingly beautiful mad scientist/steampunk alphabet blocks: http://bit.ly/Ebo4c (via @seabright) # For those who still care, a draft of my survey's reading list is posted at http://bit.ly/8cWGMy. I invite comments here or on the wiki page. # @jcmeloni Good call. in reply to jcmeloni # @DrewBrittain Let's do this. in reply to DrewBrittain # @billwolff (And if I were getting paid a real salary.) in reply to billwolff # @billwolff Maybe if I wasn't dealing with 3 sections. But I don't think I'd get everyone to buy in. # @jcmeloni Safe to assume that Huck Finn has been covered before? I'm thinking of dropping Twain since he'll not get sufficient coverage. # @twel I normally teach Dakota, Operation Nu Korea, and Traveling to Utopia in this class. in reply to twel # @j_l_r Woo! Congratulations!! in reply to j_l_r # Also worried that I'll have to cut Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries. # @jcmeloni I'm doing "The Storm" and "Desiree's Baby." Very much regionalism there. Plus she's paired with Jewett. in reply to jcmeloni # @ktcrow The final version will be posted. But right now it's all up in the air. in reply to ktcrow # @billwolff It's 1865-present. Worked fine with MWF. Condensing is what's killing me. in reply to billwolff # @jcmeloni Just one day on portions of Huck Finn. It's intro to regionalism. But I have Harris, Chesnutt, Chopin, Jewett in there as well. in reply to jcmeloni # I *need* 2 more days! What to cut? Twain? Do only one day on naturalism? <rips hair out> # @samplereality It's actually back on at the moment. Indecisive. Would love to hear/see your approach to teaching it. in reply to samplereality # @billwolff This will be 4th semester in a row teaching it. I think it deserves 3 days, but… in reply to billwolff # Wondering if I can tackle Lot 49 in 2 days to get some extra time on the syllabus… # @megavark You'd think that with the same number of minutes you could teach the same stuff. But you can't. in reply to megavark # Another cut, this one for @erinsells: John Cheever's "The Swimmer." # @seabright I've found "Sunday Morning" to be unteachable. At least for me. Have tried several times. in reply to seabright # @amandalicastro Have to do Fredrick Jackson Turner. It's how I start my survey. in reply to amandalicastro # @erinsells Sexton was never there. I've cut Moore, Rich, and Bishop. Suck it, Sells! in reply to erinsells # @seabright Eliot is in limbo right now. And Loy as well. in reply to seabright # @cscannella Well, then you should take a class from my friend @erinsells. She specializes in all things 24-hours long. in reply to cscannella # @seabright Looks like "Snow Man," "Emperor," "Anecdote of the Jar," and "13 Ways." "Sunday Morning" got the ax. # @roo_bee And thanks re: syllabus. This was Emory version. Clemson's is getting smaller. in reply to roo_bee # @roo_bee The key is to get students to describe the women. Someone will call one white or black. Others will disagree. Discuss. in reply to roo_bee # .@seabright Ginsberg, Lowell, Alexie, and Harjo. in reply to seabright # .@seabright Whitman, Dickinson, Stevens, Sandburg, WCW. Cummings, Pound, Frost, Dunbar, Hughes, McKay, Cullen, Brooks, Roethke, Plath in reply to seabright # @samplereality Oh. He's not totally gone. Just the number of poems I'm teaching are getting reduced. in reply to samplereality # For those keeping track, I have culled some of the Frost off my syllabus. Some Wallace Stevens and William Carlos Williams are dropping too. # @samplereality @loriemerson I think @georgeonline had the same problem with Hayles's book. in reply to samplereality # @bitchphd A black GAY man. Let's get my perfidy completely straight. in reply to bitchphd # @erinsells Some of the Frost is being reduced, you'll be glad to hear. in reply to erinsells # @erinsells Although I also cut the one Marianne Moore poem. in reply to erinsells # @erinsells This syllabus is surprisingly diverse qua race and gender. Take a look at the original: http://bit.ly/6T0UVU. in reply to erinsells # @academicdave I have a post stewing about the reaction to my paper, but it's gotten out of hand simply in my head. in reply to academicdave # Next loss from the great survey reduction: James Baldwin. #classprep # @twel That *is* surprising. I didn't really connect with any #slsa tweeps in 2008. Wasn't as "out" w/Twitter as I am now. in reply to twel # @wpwend42 Switching a comp course would be even harder than a survey one, I think. Still moving from TTh to MWF is harder still, I think. in reply to wpwend42 # @kgoldschmitt Wow. Sounds like a great class. What other cities? Paris and Vienna? Sao Paulo? Tokyo? in reply to kgoldschmitt # @kgoldschmitt What was left for NYC? (I hope there was some Reich in there! I almost did a PhD in music so I could obsess over him.) in reply to kgoldschmitt # @kgoldschmitt Teaching "One Art" is always wonderful. in reply to kgoldschmitt # @kgoldschmitt I feel the same. But she doesn't fit into the story that I'm telling, which involves Beats and Confessionals at this point. in reply to kgoldschmitt # I'm sad to report that the first two casualties of the Survey syllabus reduction appear to be Elizabeth Bishop and Adrienne Rich. # @jbj Singularities are impossible to detect. Whether this Starbucks's music is too loud…that's another thing altogether. in reply to jbj # @johnmjones @jbj He's the bellweather. If you see Kurzweil there, you *know* the film is solid. in reply to johnmjones # @loriemerson Absolutely! Sounds interesting. in reply to loriemerson # @loriemerson Like code, grammar is under the surface. Throw in some Chomsky, and you're good. in reply to loriemerson # @loriemerson It's also the possibility of language as process, as something that has rules that control what happens. in reply to loriemerson # @loriemerson I love talking through things like that in front of others. Always jars something loose. in reply to loriemerson # Trying to convert a MWF survey to a TTh schedule. Isn't easy. #classprep # Powered by Twitter Tools
