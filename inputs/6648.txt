It may surprise you to learn that I live a great deal of my life off-line. I know, I know, hear me out on this fantastical possibility. Recently, I’ve been offline meeting some of the most brilliant scholars across the country and I am beyond pleased to say that I have found a home among some of the best and brightest. This fall I willÂ be an Assistant Professor of Sociology at Virginia Commonwealth University.Â  That is amazing for many reasons. One good reason is that the #VCUSOCY department, as the cool kids call *us, is a dynamic, living, breathing sociological space. The students are diverse in every meaning of the word. We have a fearless leader. My new colleagues are smart and esteemed. They have boldÂ sociological imaginations. They are critically engaging the world and our place in it. They also have wonderful taste in beer and foodstuffs. VCU is in Richmond, a city as ripe for sociological inquiry as any. At the crossroads of Civil War history and New Souths and Changing Norths, Richmond is a lab beggingÂ for a motley crew of mad scientists. I hear VCU has a sportsball team that does something amazing on regular occasions? They call it Havoc. What better a place for a mannerly hellraiserÂ than a place that embraces havoc.Â
