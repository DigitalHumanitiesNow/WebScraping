For a number of reasons this is merely a News Flash, but we are extremely pleased to report that thanks to the generosity of the Andrew W.

To find out more, tune in on September 1st. Until then, we'll continue to keep you updated on partner activities, for which you could do no better than to check out the exciting stuff Bob Consoli has been up to over at Squinchpix... Â
