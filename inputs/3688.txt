Last night’s message from the provost indicated that   The University has a signed agreement with MUNACA representatives, designating animal care as an âessential serviceâ.  These essential services will ensure that proper care of animals will be maintained for the duration of the strike. For specific details as they relate to your area, please contact Dr. Jim Gourdon, Director of the McGill Animal Resources Centre (jim.gourdon@mcgill.ca).  Which makes the MAUT line about research animals (quoted in the post below) look disingenuous. I’m so annoyed by the MAUT’s position statement that I had to make another post just to express that.  Perhaps it’s because they claim that they speak for professors that I am so bothered but an apparent failure to hold to a basic standard of truth, maturity and careful reasoning.
