#oneSecond [philippadrian.com] by graphic design student Philipp Adrian aggregates all the tweets sent at exactly 14:47:36 GMT of 9 November 2012.   The 5522 Twitter messages are categorized and ordered in 4 different books. Every user is part of each book but dependent on the categorization her position within the book changes.  Accordingly, the book "My Message is..." contains the content of each message, ordered by its language. The size and order of the tweet is derived from the number of followers (recipients).   The book "My Color is..." shows each user's Twitter account color, ordered by the timezone the tweet was send in.  The book "My Description is..." shows how each user describes himself on his profile, of which the size and order is derived from the Klout score.   Finally, the book "My Name is..." lists the avatar that each user chose to represent him or herself, ordered by the number of tweets the user sent.
