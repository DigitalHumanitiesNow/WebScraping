 For me, contemporary art is at its most powerful when we can connect our own experiences and histories to an object. During my tenure at the Museum of Modern Art, I wrote a theme for the MoMA Learning website called “Investigating Identity,” now available online.Â In this theme, I delve into works that simultaneously celebrate one’s identity and question why we align ourselves with certain labels;Â art that can be highly idiosyncratic while at the same time expressing universal concepts; artists who bravely make material their personal stories, fears, and hopes. I was even able to squeeze a little feminist theory in there (in, hopefully, down-to-earth language): a little bit o’ the construction of gender, a dash o’ intersectionality. I’m hoping that art can be a vehicle for getting people to question our assumptions about the world and about ourselves.Â Happy exploring! (image)
