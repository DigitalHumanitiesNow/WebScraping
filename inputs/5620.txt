We are curating maps for an installation we call the Mapmaker Manifesto, to be displayed at the 2014 Istanbul Design Biennial this November and December!    Because of the short timeline, we've set a hard deadline of September 15, 2014 to receive submissions.  For more information, check out the official Call for Maps here: http://stamen.com/istanbul2014. Send your submissions to manifesto [at] stamen [dot] com.
