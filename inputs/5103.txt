Below is our submission for a Postcolonial Digital Humanities roundtable at the Modern Language Association at Vancouver, B.C. in January 2015. The roundtable will be presided over by Adeline Koh. Postcolonial Digital Humanities: PraxisÂ  Precis: This roundtable explores the role of praxis in the academy through the fields of postcolonial studies and the digital humanities. Roundtable participants will discuss how they actively integrate the methodologies of postcolonial analysis into the digital humanities, revealing the implicit presence of race, ethnicity and systems of exclusion. Description: This roundtable explores the role of praxis in the academy by bringing together two fields that developed in seemingly unrelated trajectories within the humanities in the 1980s: postcolonial studies and the digital humanities. Postcolonial studies draws on continental theory and philosophy to probe the power dynamics that shape the relationship of colonized people to history and culture while the digital humanities integrates the study of the humanities with digitization and programming. Yet, over the past thirty years, the fields have intersected in surprising ways. Postcolonial scholars such as Deepika Bahri and George Landow used web technologies of the 1990s to advance the field, through early sites like Postcolonial Studies at Emory and the Postcolonial Literature and Culture Web as a form of academic praxis. Intersections between theory, praxis, and the digital have been further explored by scholars of race and new media, such as Lisa Nakamura, Peter Chow-White, Pramod Nayar, Anna Everett and Alondra Nelson. Their work has begun articulating the relationship between race and technology, topographies of power in digital spaces, and the implications of globalized labor that place the burdens of producing technology in the hands of black and brown female laborers. Roundtable participants, including senior and junior scholars, activists and librarians, will discuss how they actively integrate the methodologies of postcolonial analysis into the digital humanities, revealing the implicit presence of race, ethnicity and systems of exclusion. Participants further discuss how they drawing on the digital humanitiesâ commitment to praxis, building and exploration of social media and new publishing platforms to disseminate research. There is substantial interest at the Modern Language Association annual meeting to further these discussions. Related panels at the last two MLAs (MLA 2012: âRepresenting Race: Silence and the Digital Humanitiesâ and âAccessing Race in the Digital Humanitiesâ; MLA 2013: âDecolonizing the Digital Humanitiesâ), all resulted in full rooms. This roundtable goes further to crystallize these conversations by elaborating what the âpraxisâ–the actual political practice of postcolonial digital humanities could look like.   Our conversations hinge on a set of questions: What does a politically inflected digital humanities praxis look like? What is the role of activism in the postcolonial digital humanities? How can social media be most effectively leveraged in postcolonial digital humanities praxis and activism, and what are its limits? Is postcolonial digital humanities an imperialist project because of its beginnings in the United States, and how can this be mitigated? How can scholars of postcolonial studies and digital humanities better account for the needs, representations, and legiblities of vulnerable populations? This roundtable presents seven participants limited to five-minute remarks on the praxis of postcolonial digital humanities. The goals for the remarks are to stimulate conversation between the audience and the roundtable. We are reserving 40 minutes for discussion. Roopika Risam will discuss the relationship between pedagogy and praxis. She will outline a theoretical framework for what she terms “postcolonial digital pedagogy,” a set of teaching practices that engage technology to decolonize the classroom and orient students towards significant learning experiences that extend the scope of learning beyond curricula and institution walls. In doing so, she proposes that the intersections of pedagogy and technology are a fruitful locus for engaged praxis. Eunsong Angela KimÂ will examine the political discourse around âtrendingâ and âtagging.â She will examine the leftist discourse of surprise and dismay at certain trendsâspecifically #solidarityisforwhitewomen and #cancelcolbert. Criticism of the tags situated the trending of such conversations to be an exceptional and a misdirected, mis-use of digital energy by racialized and gendered users. Utilizing ZeynepÂ Tufecki’s analysis on the politics of twitter algorithms, she will contextually examine the function of a trend alongside the potential deployment of intimate sabotage (Spivak) in postcolonial tagging. Siobhan Senier will give a brief overview of current trends in the digitization of indigenous heritage materials; explain the theoretical underpinnings of projects that seek to enlist tribal communities in co-curation of their source materials; and detail the challenges currently faced by tribal museums, archives and libraries who want to conduct their own independent digitization projects. Angel David Nieves will discuss current digitization efforts in South Africa as related to the many historical collections being held in local township museums, particularly in Johannesburg. Â Including community members in the archive-making process involves re-inscribing traumatic events into the public sphere and negotiating how we collect, document, analyze and provide access to these narratives on the Internet. Â An intersectional framework that engages the âpostcolonial archiveâ and critical race theory provides new avenues for interrogating and dealing with a difficult past. Porter Olsenâs talk explores the relationship between contemporary hacktivism and the anti-imperial movements of the early to mid 20th century. Looking beyond the hackers and hacktivist that dominate western newspapers, he outlines the otherwise obscure history of hacking and hacktivism in the global south, and how that history has led to the figure of what he calls the âpostcolonial hackerâ in novels such as Hari Kunzruâs Transmission and Lauren Beukeâs Moxyland, showing how hacktivists of the global southâboth fictional and realâreframe the work of anti-imperial thinkers such as Frantz Fanon for our era of globalized neocolonialism. Alex Gil argues that the early career of AimÃ© CÃ©saire marks a moment in the history of the transatlantic region when existing publishing networks open up to new racial dynamics, particularly within the American Hemisphere. In this presentation he shows how the use of computational approaches can help us generate new understandings of the formation of a new anti-colonial republic of letters, and serve as the base for creating the postcolonial digital edition of the future.
