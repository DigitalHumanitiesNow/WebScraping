Thyroid Cancer Canada just launched their new website: http://www.thyroidcancercanada.org.  I definitely don’t fit their main demographic but have found them to be an incredibly useful resource throughout my experience.  Rita Banach their president, has worked tirelessly to update and modernize their web presence.  Thyroid cancer is still underrepresented in the broader cultural discourse around cancer, and when it is, it is generally as “the good cancer,” which as you know, I hate.  TCC has done lots to raise awareness and provide resources to people going through it, from all walks of life. I’ve added links to them, and to the US-based Thyroid Cancer Survivors Association in my right panel.   If you’re looking for a place to donate some money, I would certainly recommend both organizations.
