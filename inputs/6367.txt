A major new dataset for seventeenth century London is now live on British History Online. Listing name, residence and other information about the inhabitants of London and Middlesex for three collections of the tax in the 1660s, it is the product of the AHRC-funded London Hearth Tax Project, based at Roehampton, in collaboration with Birkbeck College and the Centre for Metropolitan History at the IHR. As well as being a fundamental source for historians of metropolitan London, it is likely to provide the missing link in a great many family history chains, since genealogical sources are a good deal fewer for the seventeenth century than for later periods. The full project database is also available for download and re-use in SAS-Space, the institutional repository for the School of Advanced Study.
