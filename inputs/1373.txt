The American Studies Graduate Students' Committee at the University of Austin, Texas is hosting a conference entitled "Defining 'American' Values." Here's the call for papers.  The Virginia Forum, which will take place in April 2006, hopes to confront the lack of venues available for discussion on all aspects of Virginia history. I plan to submit a paper to this conference, either on a history of "clean-up" weeks in Virginia's cities or a shortened version of my doctoral research seminar paper.
