New-form scholarship reconsiders citation and peer-review, while re-imagining the containers and audiences for academic work. Digital platforms, like Twitter, open-access journals, and blogs offer both limitations and possibilities. The public digital humanities is built around networked learning communities, not repositories for content, and its scholarly product is a conversation, one that engages a broad public while blurring the distinction between research, teaching, service, and outreach. In short, the public digital humanities starts with humans, not technologies or tools.    New-form Scholarship and the Public digital humanities  from Jesse Stommel
