Our lovely friends at #dhpoco, Adeline Koh and Roopika Risam, are guest editing a special upcoming issue of Ada, A journal of Gender, New Media, and Technology, and it looks awesome. The special #dhpoco issue will addressÂ Gender, Globalization, and the Digital. According to the CFP (linked above): In this issue we seek essays that explore gender and sexuality concerns in digital spaces and cultures, as well as academic fields such as the digital humanities and computational sciences. Possible topics include: what is the shape of the global âgender gapâ? Where are digital products produced and consumed and how do these reveal economic, social and structural inequalities? How do global flows of capitalism construct uneven modernities around the world? How do race and ethnicity intersect with the structure of gendered, global digital communities and diasporas? How does the digital provide and police spaces for organizing around trans issues? What are the networks of affect, intimacy and sexuality that grow out of digital cultures?Â  How are operations of interface, output and input structured by ideas of gender, sexuality and language? How do access and ableism structure issues of gender and sexuality in digital spaces? Submit full essays of 3000 words (max) to adelinekoh[at]gmail[dot]com and rrisam[at]gmail[dot]com byÂ 30th September 2014Â for consideration.
