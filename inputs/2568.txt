With our Digital Dialogue speaker series,Â MITH aims to foster community by extending an open offer to interestedÂ graduate students, staff, and faculty to request one of a limited number of spots to join our speakers for lunch. This is a great opportunity to engage directly with the speakers and discuss their work in a less formal setting. Our Spring 2015 season starts up with Shannon Mattern on February 24,Â and space is limited, so please fill outÂ this form as soon as possible with your information and speaker preferences. Requests will be accepted on a rolling basis, but are first come, first served. Â Any questions can be sent to Stephanie Sapienza at sapienza@umd.edu.
