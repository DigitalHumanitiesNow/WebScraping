Iâve been reading an excellent biography of Thomas Aquinas and came across this quote, which Iâd like to append to all my writings from now on:     If anyone, glorifying himself with false knowledge, dares to argue against what I have just written, let him not babble in the corners or with infants who are incapable of judging such a difficult subject, but let him write against this book â if he dares.  You will then have to deal not solely with me, who am only the least in this affair, but with a crowd of other lovers of the truth who know how to resist your errors and remedy your ignorance.   Got that, quodlibbers?  Anyone who wants to talk smack about hypostatic union better lock and load.  Thatâs Thomas with âSt.,â yo.  The biography is Saint Thomas Aquinas: The Person and His Work by Jean-Pierre Torrell.
