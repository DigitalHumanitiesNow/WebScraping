Jeremy Keith's reference section to DOM Scripting and WestCiv's Stylemaster Podguide, both available for download to put in your iPod's Notes folder. Ah, now when I'm riding the bike at the gym I can read about DOM scripting and CSS in addition to my notes on history books (which I do already, and it's kinda handy).
