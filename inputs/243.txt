Solomon Addis Getahun (Central Michigan University) discusses the history of Ethiopian immigrants and refugees in the USA.  He describes the diversity of Ethiopians in the diaspora and their community organizations.  For example, to overcome isolation and carve out an autonomous space within US society, in 1984 Ethiopians established the Ethiopian Sports Federation in North America. Its annual football (soccer) tournament provides a festive place where Ethiopian identity is negotiated, recreated and modified.
