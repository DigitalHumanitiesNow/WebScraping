and I’m in Europe for 4 weeks.  We just got to Paris, which is lovely (I’d never been).  We’re near the Bastille for two days before moving into an apartment.  In England, I had a wonderful time at the Supersonix conference, and the highlight was recording a bit of the intro to MP3 onto a ca. 1900 phonograph cylinder as part of Aleks Kolkowski’s Phonographies project.   But things have already been quite slow in this space, and probably will continue to be, apart from occasional announcements, until fall.  Though every time I say that, something comes up.
