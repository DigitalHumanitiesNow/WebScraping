My Ukrainian grandparents Nadia and Petro Olijnyk arrived in Australia as postwar refugees in 1949. Petro died in 2005 and Nadia in 2009, each in their mid-90s. My grandfather loved telling stories and holding an audience. Nadia would sit with him, listening, but Petro would never allow her to take over. However, when he wasnât with her she would sometimes tell her own stories and I was struck by how different they were from his. This paper focuses not on Nadiaâs storytelling but her story writing, something she began to do in her late 80s for the first time in her life.
