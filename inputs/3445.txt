Online courses with very large enrollments have rapidly matured in the last two years, led largely by experiments outside mainstream academia byÂ Coursera,Â UdacityÂ andÂ edX. Ambitious educators, technologists, and funders have created courses on diverse topics, and overÂ five million students worldwide have registered for classes. And 3% have completed the courses. What can we learn?  TheseÂ Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) create “a strange paradox: these professors are simultaneously the most and least accessible teachers in history. And itâs not the only tension inherent in MOOCs,” writes A. J. Jacobs in the Sunday Review. Jacobs recently signed up for 11 courses (of which he completed 2), and graded his experience: B+ for the professors, who tended to be charming and theatrical, trying to make the best of the virtual environment. There’s no patience for crummy professors, as in a math course canceled in 2012 by Udacity. A for convenience, which is unmatched as students can learn from home, while commuting, worldwide. Start and stop anytime. D for student-teacher interaction, which is virtually nonexistent. It’s one-way delivery from pop-star teachers, a virtual lottery to get a professor to answer a specific question. B- for student-student interaction, which is vital for cementing the newly-learned knowledge, but even the best online discussions lack the immediacy of real life. There’s also a signal-to-noise problem, as well as trolling. B- for assignments, which are heavily multiple-choice quizzes (great for computers to grade, bad for measuring learning), rampant with cheating, and lackluster when peer-review is used for essays. B overall, which a generally positive experience, but minimal practical application when taking diverse subjects, and the courses don’t convey any credentials. The hot air surrounding the rise of MOOCs is beginning to subside, and the ideas will percolate other fields. On the academic end of the spectrum, traditional academia must and will respond to the pressures that are disrupting their industry. MOOCs are different in many ways from the “distance education” of the last few decades. How will universities compete with free? How will they justify being on-campus as the virtual experience improves? How much can the traditional, intimate classroom model of learning be bastardized before it looses all meaningful value, reduced to little more than watching TV? This 18 minute TEDx talk by Michele Pistone discusses the future of higher education, and its historical origins: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsiQ6-JTOWM (Read more comments on Pistone’s talk.) Of greater interest to this blog, is informal and professional learning. This is the opposite situation, as MOOCs have much to teach us. If you are involved you outreach, take inspiration from MOOCs about: Approaches to improving online learning (adding assessment, interactivity and community) Adding social aspects (online forums, exploring peer review, and seeing what formats prod students to engage) Implementation (user interfaces, software, marketing angles) It’s all about packaging. The underlying elements (articles, videos, forums, etc.) have been on the internet for some time, and many organizations already have these ingredients at hand. What differentiates anÂ “online course” is how it’s all combined, the outcomes (both learning objectives and certification), and the overall cohesiveness of the package. How can you deliver learning with online courses? (And do you want to?)
