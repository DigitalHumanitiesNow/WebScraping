The blog stats are simply astounding.  Tens â nay, teens â of people finding their way to my blog.  Do they seek enlightenment through cartoonish dialogues?  Solemn meditations on cooking?  Pronouncements on programming languages and aesthetics?  No, silly, they want the syllabus!  The course enrollment is bursting at the seams (as is my email with override requests from prospective students).  So let me say right now: the subject is dull, the assignments are impossible, and the professor is a jerk.  Oh, who am I kidding?  The subject is fascinating and the professor is a sweetheart!  (Sorry, the assignments really are impossible).  He looks forward to welcoming everyone on Monday.
