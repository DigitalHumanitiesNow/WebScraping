 @DrewBrittain Best. Week. Evar. in reply to DrewBrittain # @ecriturefemme Great. We should have a tweetup. in reply to ecriturefemme # @BenRobertson Totally. We can also start food fights. in reply to BenRobertson # @eetempleton I didn't get an invite for 18 months after I applied. Too bad for both of you. # @triproftri This will be my third grading. I've never done a NEH thing alas. in reply to triproftri # @erinsells Oh noes! Who's going to go to the ball game with me then? Curses! in reply to erinsells # Is anyone else doing the AP Literature grading this year? @erinsells, @georgeonline, @ryancordell? # @johnmjones This year I'm going from #thatcamp to #geoinst  so my return flight will be from Charlottesville. in reply to johnmjones # @johnmjones I did Sunday last year around 4-5pm. Wasn't a problem. Things wrapped around 1pm last year. in reply to johnmjones # @fearv I own both Grizzly Bear albums and have never listened to either. #fail in reply to fearv # Plane tickets for #thatcamp and #geoinst purchased. My wife loves me to let me go to these DH parties. # @fearv It's a fun album. Kind of like if The Go! Team got more rock and roll. in reply to fearv # @andthensydsaid It's a plane ticket party tonight!!1! in reply to andthensydsaid # Trying to plan my travel for #geoinst  What time will we be ending, @nowviskie, on Thursday? # @jaheppler We've been in ours for 7 years now, but we're finally getting around to changing what's been a very heavy, chocolate brown. in reply to jaheppler # @erinsells Nope. And while I haven't heard the new one, I was more or less meh on the first. So don't expect it. in reply to erinsells # Choosing colors for the house is really hard. # I did way too much #grading today. 17 5+ page papers. Hard to feel like you can even see when you're done with that. #eng399 #e399 # @erinsells The paperwork for mine was very minimal. 2 forms and my 1040, I think. Turn-around time was under 2 weeks. in reply to erinsells # @erinsells You know about http://ibrinfo.org/, right? in reply to erinsells # @thombrooks I'd say it was worth it. Starts a bit slow, but ends well. in reply to thombrooks # Painters have just arrived at the house. # Amber and I have finally knocked out both seasons of Flight of the Conchords. # @therefore I don't even get the night shift some times. So. Tired. in reply to therefore # @kmsqrd I had 11/12 students wearing orange. Normally would be 1 at most. They RT'd, so they all saw it. Which proves they undersand Twitter in reply to kmsqrd # My teaching days mean that I miss the entire Twitter happenings. # @eetempleton I'm *always* in the perfect MZD mindset. 4 hours makes me too much like Johnny. in reply to eetempleton # 4 hours of sleep does not necessarily a good professor make. # @farman It adds such an interesting dimension to some texts. I did it in my diss for @GreatDismal's *Pattern Recognition* as well. in reply to farman # @kmsqrd It's not so much about school spirit as it is about testing the quickness of the Twitter network in my media theory/lit class. in reply to kmsqrd # @farman The discussion was a bit rushed (I get that way at the end of the semester since I have too much to do). But I'll post soon, I hope. in reply to farman # @farman I can definitely post it, although I don't know if it makes sense w/o lecture notes. Maybe should post those too. in reply to farman # Working on my .kmz for tomorrow's discussion of Jhumpa Lahiri's "Sexy." # Dear #eng465 students: 5 points extra credit for wearing Clemson orange tomorrow. # @HannahRabon It happens at the end of the semester. Rally the troops. And recognize that I'm a bit behind on grading (ftw?). in reply to HannahRabon # @zachwhalen I actually think I could teach Lot 49 and Daisy Miller without re-reading them at this point. (Thought @ this all day). # @LookBackMaps Link? in reply to LookBackMaps # @ibogost Will do! in reply to ibogost # @jcmeloni You're way too kind. The very heartiest congratulations! in reply to jcmeloni # @Scrivenings I think I'm going to be working with WC integration with library, among other things FWIW. in reply to Scrivenings # @buzzdad We're thinking of a cruise this summer. Sounds like I need to consult with you. # Other hash tags appropriate for the previous tweet: #socialmedia #openprofessoriate #alt ac #allmyinternetfriends # Many thanks for congratulations.I'd be lying if I didn't say Twitter is a big contributor to any success I enjoy these days. #jobmarket # @jtheibault The sad thing is that you only get a 2-year break from the tweets! in reply to jtheibault # @rachaelsullivan Congrats!! # @HannahRabon Me too, in some ways. Will miss teaching #e399 in reply to HannahRabon # @erinsells Ouch. in reply to erinsells # I've just accepted a 2-year CLIR post-doc at Emory. Take that, ye mad #jobmarket gods! # @samplereality @zachwhalen I like the description of it as a mule, except insofar that it did lead to THAT, which seems more a dead end. in reply to samplereality # @zachwhalen @samplereality I tend to call it the rebirth of the novel. Or demonstration of what books can do that no other media can. in reply to zachwhalen # @zachwhalen Wow. I have yet to get to that place with any book yet. And this one least of all. Like to have it all very fresh. in reply to zachwhalen # @zachwhalen It's also more experimental and provocative than a lot of the e-lit I do…although you teach a LOT more of it than I do. in reply to zachwhalen # Am very glad to be turning off my computer for a bit and to lurch back into House of Leaves. #classprep # @muziejus That makes sense. It's more because I schlep a mouse along with me in a backpack and wires get old after a while. in reply to muziejus # @JenHoward I agree. I have questions about the Agrippa Files (http://bit.ly/XXyJ8) for the same reason. in reply to JenHoward # @johnmjones It's pretty clear that they said public tweets. in reply to johnmjones # @JenHoward Evanescence also makes bad music. in reply to JenHoward # RT @librarycongress: Library to acquire ENTIRE Twitter archive — ALL public tweets, ever, since March 2006! [Guess Twitter *does* matter] # @triproftri Thanks! in reply to triproftri # @triproftri Link to the assignment? in reply to triproftri # @samplereality Those are some flowing locks! in reply to samplereality # @samplereality http://onceyoustartregisteringdomainnamesitshardtostop.net in reply to samplereality # @academicdave I've read a lot of good reviews for those, but they're out of production, it seems. in reply to academicdave # @inactinique It's a strange one. I can't explain why it means what it does, however. in reply to inactinique # @zachwhalen As always, technology trains the body. # @zachwhalen My Father-in-law uses one, and I feel the same way. They are great when you use them a lot. But if not, the thumb isn't trained. in reply to zachwhalen # @inactinique My previous to you was meant as tongue-in-cheek. in reply to inactinique # @inactinique Curses. And you know they won't be refunding my invite either. in reply to inactinique # @erinsells They don't know what they risk missing with you. # .@muziejus Good point. I welcome all advice re: mice since my current one isn't Bluetooth. Make a good case for your preferred device! in reply to muziejus # Also, @jcmeloni suggests that I could write a @ProfHacker post about my quest to buy a mouse…provided you guys provide advice! # It appears that I have some Google Voice invites. Does anyone want one at this point? # I've decided that the best thing I got from the @macheist Nano Bundle 2 is Clips (http://bit.ly/9NPlSX). I use it nonstop. # .@betajames It's both. Just like literacy. in reply to betajames # @samhoff Twittering professors FTW! in reply to samhoff # @johnmjones I was wondering about the MS 5000, but I don't know how I'd feel about the smaller, travel mouse size. Magic Mouse = too much $. in reply to johnmjones # I'm now providing translations as best as possible from Dutch to English about medical insurance terminology. #fail # @sfirth605 No matter how creepy you are, it's nothing on Walt. in reply to sfirth605 # It appears I broke my mouse yesterday when I accidentally dropped it yesterday. Now accepting advice for a Bluetooth-capable replacement. # My sister-in-law, on her way home from 3 months NGO work in Africa just got hospitalized in Amsterdam for malaria. # @jcmeloni I'm not sure what your or my schedule is for tomorrow, so I'm going to wish you luck now. Despite your not needing it. # @whitneyboles That's a hell of a fortune cookie. in reply to whitneyboles # @dancohen Ups to @chnm and #thatcamp in return! in reply to dancohen # My biggest #thatcamp 2009 regret: being out of the room when @georgeonline and @jbj cooked up @profhacker. Curse you, Indian food! # @academicdave I know it's supposed to be portable, but I really doubt that running with it is a good idea. in reply to academicdave # RT @ProfHacker: No, we won't be behind the @Chronicle paywall. Yes, we were dreamed up because of #THATCamp 2009. w00t! # @iantrevor That's right! No pay wall, editorially independence, CC-license. in reply to iantrevor # @amandafrench The first posts of next week will feature our gold-plated hot tub time machine! Venture Capital ftw! in reply to amandafrench # @nowviskie We do real like California cheese! (Or something like that…) in reply to nowviskie # @mackenziecruce @JawsdeLine No. @DrewBrittain is zen. in reply to mackenziecruce # Big news for @ProfHacker: "We're Moving!" http://bit.ly/cxyMbw # @kelsosCorner Just teaching him in my survey course. He is just fun to teach. in reply to kelsosCorner # @samplereality The students aren't really sure what to make of someone who is willing to play with his own characters' lives. in reply to samplereality # @samplereality I liked Flight, but I prefer the short stories, esp. read against the novels. He tells the same stories but switches chars. in reply to samplereality # @samplereality "Because my father…," "Do not go Gentle," and all the poems in 7th Ed of Norton. Also, Joy Harjo. in reply to samplereality # Tomorrow is Sherman Alexie day! # @andthensydsaid I was worried that you were going to say #eng465 in reply to andthensydsaid # Why am I doing #classprep at midnight again? # @cscannella That's what I thought when I found out myself a few months back. in reply to cscannella # Listening to the third new album today: Lusine. A little too down tempo for the gym. #music # @erinsells Fuck Buttons at the moment. in reply to erinsells # @FelixSmerd The Braves *are* blowing it, aren't they? in reply to FelixSmerd # My newest at @ProfHacker discusses how to "Speed Up Your Searching in Firefox": http://bit.ly/caHy51. # Newest post for @ProfHacker is scheduled. Time to go home and see the family. # @DrewBrittain That makes sense. I've actually expected more quick questions. The time I chose is probably not ideal either. in reply to DrewBrittain # @Sethuality Way to stay on top of the assignment. in reply to Sethuality # My digital office hours this semester have largely been a bust as far as students taking advantage of them. # RT @ProfHacker: New at ProfHacker: @jcmeloni goes to the archives to discuss "Website Hosting 101" http://bit.ly/bEseF3 # @joguldi Nice to have a place to slot that. (Not that I'm going to read it again anytime soon…) in reply to joguldi # And yes, I have in fact just pre-ordered the newest @GreatDismal novel. # @joguldi Oh, I love WCW's poetry. But that project seemed so strange to a non-historian. in reply to joguldi # @samplereality Very. If it's a business, I normally block as well. I'm always amazed at their follower count, but it's probably other bizs. in reply to samplereality # Amazon couldn't have come up with a better way for me to spend ll my money there than with Amazon Prime. # @joguldi That was perhaps the worst thing that I read for my qualifying exams. in reply to joguldi # @clioweb Thanks! in reply to clioweb # @clioweb Any hotels in the area? Or are there specific ones? None listed on http://bit.ly/cqhBf1. in reply to clioweb # @clioweb @amandafrench Is there going to be conference rate for #thatcamp hotels again? # @tigress31485 @andthensydsaid The notes are now open: http://bit.ly/9rB3AP. Sorry to ruin the dream. in reply to tigress31485 # @tigress31485 @andthensydsaid Actually, it means that you are to choose if you want Wave or wiki. Let me know, and I'll take care of it. in reply to tigress31485 # Having finished waving-chill, I'm listening to Telekinesis, which I apparently have owned for most of a year and not heard. #music #overload # @mkirschenbaum @brettbobley Smelling bad is a pre-req for good shows. I'm always jealous of what's playing there. in reply to mkirschenbaum # @digitalhumanist I <3 me some music that sounds like it's a Miami Vice soundtrack cassette that's been worn almost through. in reply to digitalhumanist # @digitalhumanist I've got them all except toro y moi. I'll check them out. FWIW I like "glo-fi" better than "chillwave." Funnier. in reply to digitalhumanist # @dancohen You go to *all* the best meetings. Care to trade lives? in reply to dancohen # @cforster Yeah, I think it's strange that I'm seeing more titles there than theses. in reply to cforster # I really, really love Washed Out. #music # @cforster It's brand-new. A @profhacker reader built it after one of @jbj's posts about ChatRoulette. in reply to cforster # @erinsells Hmm. That's not a great prompt. How about doing a "Is My Thesis Hot or Not?" workshop. You could even use: http://bit.ly/9R6rkZ. in reply to erinsells # @erinsells What are you teaching? in reply to erinsells # @mkirschenbaum Do all shows at the 9:30 club start at 9:30? in reply to mkirschenbaum # Time to try something I've never done before. # @omg_dinoz Double-extra cool points for that. in reply to omg_dinoz # RT @omg_dinoz http://xkcd.com/472/ #eng465 # Powered by Twitter Tools
