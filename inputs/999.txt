Trevor Owens (Institute of Museum and Library Services) has written a post on his blog, reflectingÂ on his experience teaching aÂ Digital Public HistoryÂ seminar at the University of Maryland’s College of Information Studies. “Becoming Digital Public Historians” references both the title of aÂ course unit and, Owens argues, a “kind of identity work [that] is at the core of what graduate education is supposed to be about.” The post details the eight students’ final projects, which cover a broad range of collections, approaches, tools, and platforms. Owens concludes: It took me a bit of time to shift gears from teaching a digital history course to public history students to teaching a digital public history course to iSchool students. With that said, the experience made me realize how relevant I think digital public history is to the future of libraries and archives.
