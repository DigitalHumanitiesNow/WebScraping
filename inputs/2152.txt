I am developing a data set that charts the relationships between rabbis in antiquity.  I am now keeping this data in tabular form (rabbi x/term of relationship/rabbi y).  Could anyone recommend a software package - preferably open source and not too difficult to use - that can help me visualize and analyze this data?
