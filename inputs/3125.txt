Q: How many Finch committee members does it take to change a lightbulb?A: The lightbulb doesn't need to be changed, it just needs a large injection of public funds to transition it to a more illuminating condition.One of the Finch committee members has gone public on the tricky balancing actÂ that the committee tried to maintain. In his words "Green was unacceptable to funders unless learned societies and publishers were willing to allow it". In my words, the committee was structured so that publishers' interests trumped all other considerations.
