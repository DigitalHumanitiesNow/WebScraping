 @KickakiteWunder You and me both. in reply to KickakiteWunder # @mattthomas We've discovered that grandchildren and great-grandchildren are great inducements to learning new technologies. # @mattthomas No. I was just doing that weird parent thing where one talks from their kids' perspective. in reply to mattthomas # @billiehara You're very welcome. We had it last weekend. And then Amber ate the leftovers behind my back. # @cscannella It just gets better and better. in reply to cscannella # @DrewBrittain But to be snarky, I *did* own it well before the beginning of the semester. So don't front! Or some such… in reply to DrewBrittain # @DrewBrittain Sadly my reviews and picks aren't in real time. I follow the muse and write when I've got spare time. in reply to DrewBrittain # Sunday afternoon Skype-ing with the grandparents. # My latest mp3 of the week features The xx. If you want dark, gloomy, and spare w/pop sensibility, this is for you: http://bit.ly/cVa4Hd. # Resolved. Our next water heater needs to be bigger than 40 gallons. # I kid you not. I just received a rejection letter from the NEH for a job I applied to in February…2009. #jobmarket # @xentahl Haven't heard of Clubroot before, but I will check them out certainly. in reply to xentahl # Time to prep for the next #jobmarket interview. # @drnels Oh, I didn't even apply to any jobs there. It's just the dream logic. My id has decided *you* are the job fairy, apparently. in reply to drnels # @academicdave You've absolutely got to check out Burial's album *Untrue*: http://bit.ly/bpUlQ0. in reply to academicdave # @boonebgorges Oops. Forget to append the hashtag for that previous: #dontknowwhatimtalkingabout. in reply to boonebgorges # @boonebgorges Which is why there should be an update of the standard that allows people to push comments from readers. in reply to boonebgorges # I dreamt last night that @drnels wrote and offered me a tenure-track job. # Trying to write a quick resume to apply for an #alt-ac job. #jobmarket # @Scrivenings I'll see what my schedule can handle. Phone interview this morning and tons of grading to do. in reply to Scrivenings # @Scrivenings For most of the day, I think. in reply to Scrivenings # It's a very good day to be on Emory's campus since Spring Break is on Monday, everyone's already cleared out. # @ryancordell You better be rubbing her feet, sir. in reply to ryancordell # @kelseyagnew Trust me: that is the slamfizziest reason for getting the PhD. in reply to kelseyagnew # @williamjturkel As long as you're not wearing someone else's wearables, I think you'll be okay. in reply to williamjturkel # @amandafrench Yes. From students. #fail in reply to amandafrench # @DrewBrittain That album is brilliant. One of my favorites of last several years. I listen late at night while working most of the time. in reply to DrewBrittain # I was supposed to grade for the last two hours. Instead, I juggled the 70+ emails that I received in the last 8 hours. # @DrewBrittain Have you listened to Burial's album Untrue? 'Cuz there's a song called "In McDonalds." # Oh wow. Lego is now making board games: http://bit.ly/b8fEPV. I'm sold. # Sorting out students' access to the timeline's spreadsheet less than one hour before their work is due. # @DrewBrittain You didn't take @kickakitewunder or @jociland to the doctor with you, did you? # @eetempleton What an awful category. I might not listen to them again. #snob in reply to eetempleton # @emusic I think we should be able to subscribe to artists and you email/RSS us when new album, EP, or single is added to their page. # @eetempleton Not where I would have thought that they would play, however. in reply to eetempleton # @eetempleton It's an interesting venue. Old mill. Floor creaks when heavy bands play. But it's nice and big/open inside. in reply to eetempleton # Short review: the Local Natives album is Fleet Foxes with a little more rock. Good stuff. Will get better with more listens. #music # Playing around with the Cooliris FF plugin (http://bit.ly/am2NSj) for the first time in a while. Surprised Apple hasn't bought this company. # @DrewBrittain No. I meant the regular Quarter Pounder. Maybe they've changed the numbers since I worked there? in reply to DrewBrittain # I'm amused by how many students are telling me they are "bad at technology." # @DrewBrittain So that's you and @HannahRabon. That makes 2 out of 20. I'm writing an article on this experiment, you know. in reply to DrewBrittain # @HannahRabon That's what Twitter is for. Or something like that. Too bad the rest of #e399 doesn't agree. in reply to HannahRabon # @DrewBrittain @JociLand The answer should always be #3. in reply to DrewBrittain # @HannahRabon Not really sad. It just means you're on the Internet less than I am. # @DrewBrittain I was trying to suggest that only boring people get bored. But I was trying to not be rude. I should've just thrown a grenade. in reply to DrewBrittain # @DrewBrittain Only boring people get… in reply to DrewBrittain # @DrewBrittain The Atlanta Beach House show sold out faster than anything I've seen in a while. Should e good. in reply to DrewBrittain # @drewbrittain Did you ever listen to Washed Out? # @nickproth @AlexRAAWR This has been happening to few people.Email me a regular Gmail address and I'll add to sheet when I'm home from gym. # @eetempleton Well, @jbj developed the first round of the assignment while I did code. I've adapted & newly added geospatial stuff to asnmnt in reply to eetempleton # @triproftri Good question. Here's the rubric: http://bit.ly/aSBnIl. And here's the assignment: http://bit.ly/6xuoAk. in reply to triproftri # @zachwhalen Something for us *all* to hope for. in reply to zachwhalen # @zachwhalen Now *there's* a way to spark interest. in reply to zachwhalen # A problem with the timeline, however, is how long it is currently taking me to grade them. Need to go faster. # Students are starting to populate our #eng399 #e399 timeline: http://bit.ly/9jWNSn. # @HannahRabon TTIWWOP in reply to HannahRabon # @academicdave This is true. But educators also need to be paid. (Not that one can't start new models. But they're hard to start) in reply to academicdave # @mlaconvention I had you pegged as the judge. You are our Probst. (Not to be confused with Proust…) in reply to mlaconvention # @samplereality I think that we give that role to @mlaconvention. I'm okay with being the closet addict. I've always loved a good closet. in reply to samplereality # @samplereality The Republican. in reply to samplereality # @samplereality This seems easy…although potentially libelous. But saying that, I'll put you down as the "Puck" character. in reply to samplereality # New at ProfHacker: âWhatâs for lunch?  Bean salad!" by @billiehara http://bit.ly/cWWLrT (via @ProfHacker) # @samplereality So we have to pitch it to the right network. And supply a *lot* more coffee/alcohol. in reply to samplereality # @cforster I'm just saying that I've seen things in grad school that would make good TV. in reply to cforster # @triproftri @samplereality It's both. I think we need a reality show based on the professoriat. Or grad school. in reply to triproftri # @kelseyagnew Much luck of the shamrock-shake variety! in reply to kelseyagnew # Second phone interview of the week completed. Fairly successfully, I think. #jobmarket # @samplereality If the bears had published another article or two, then they certainly would have made it to escape velocity. in reply to samplereality # @HannahRabon That's an interesting connection that I hadn't thought about previously. in reply to HannahRabon # @erinsells What do you think of new Shout Out Louds? I listened yesterday for first time and was bored to tears. # @nowviskie That sounds like an awesome event. Will be interesting to hear what @the_real_jizzy_mcgann has to say. in reply to nowviskie # @JociLand Will never happen. Halting State is too good to skip out on due to weather. in reply to JociLand # @DrewBrittain Of course! You don't think a pesky job search is going to keep me from enlightening the likes of you, do you? in reply to DrewBrittain # Campus visit scheduled. It *must* have been mentioning Google Buzz in that letter. #jobmarket # @KickakiteWunder I knew there was a reason I liked that guy. in reply to KickakiteWunder # @JociLand Awesome find. in reply to JociLand # @ryancordell @Scrivenings If @jbj is out-hipstering us, it's because he's…uh…got a…uh…hip. in reply to ryancordell # @ryancordell @Scrivenings I suppose it's 2 to 1 until @jbj weighs in with his pronouncement. in reply to ryancordell # @ryancordell Don't let @jbj fool you. Boys & Girls is the superior album. in reply to ryancordell # @erinsells Weird, huh? in reply to erinsells # Strangely enough, I received a phone call to set up another interview while on the phone with the current group. #jobmarket #whenitrains # It might not be surprising (http://bit.ly/bxLDVA) but I *might* have pre-drafted a thank-you note for my just-ended interview. #jobmarket # I'm so not above name dropping. And you'd be surprised how many of you figure in my upcoming phone interview. #jobmarket # My fingers are not lining up quite right with my keyboard today. Not quite sure what's going on. # @academicdave I'm listening to The Embassy for the same reason. in reply to academicdave # @captain_primate @jbj Well, provided the original Greek is a 7th-grade reading level. in reply to captain_primate # @sfirth605 What's the problem? Boring assignment? Or is it just not working? #eng399 in reply to sfirth605 # @captain_primate @jbj Don't let him tell you how often they've read the Iliad to him. in reply to captain_primate # Am trying a new approach to scheduling my days today. All aimed toward the 3pm phone interview. #jobmarket # The newest by @jcmeloni at @ProfHacker discusses "A Few Ways to Back Up Your Website" http://bit.ly/b1cJbF.
