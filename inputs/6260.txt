  A federal judge has just ruled that Apple violated antitrust laws, colluding with publishers to promote the “agency” model and raise the price of e-books, just as its iPad with iBooks app was set to debut in 2010. Apple denies price fixing and calls it competition instead.   I know this is about hard-nosed commerce, with high stakes for publishers. But I’m fascinated by the way implicit cultural fears–of the death of books, based on a perceived opposition of physical and digital media–are either alluded to or cited in the ruling and the stories about it. The ruling accuses Apple of taking advantage of the publishersâ âfear of and frustrationâ over Amazon’s power, but it’s clear that some of that “fear” goes deeper than just pricing. As The New York Times articulates it:    The antitrust suit underscored the turmoil in the book industry as readers shift from ink and paper to electronic devices like tablets and smartphones, where they can buy books with the push of a button. The publishers want to embrace new media, but they are also trying to protect their profits and retain control of their businesses.   Over at Wired, the decision is seen as shoring up Amazon’s monopoly in a way that might finally lead to the often-predicted death of the (paper) book:   A rise in prices and a drop in sales might just speed the day when the print book become an artifact, a kind of luxury version of literature prized for its beauty as an object but not taken seriously as a vehicle for the everyday business of reading.   Then the piece accelerates into apocalyptic speculation about the cultural effects of this battle between “literature” vs. “business,” a vision based on a kind of digital dualism and technological determinism often associated with Wired:   If that happens, the idea of the book itself could start to fade as a meaningful concept, much as the album in the era of digital music already has. Killing off old media and making way for the new is one thing technology does well. The death throes of the old media are typically viewed with alarm at first, followed by an acceptance of the seeming inevitability of their passing.   The cultural loss of the “idea of the book  … as a meaningful concept!” In this account digital vs. physical is a dramatic death match, and “technology” is always only on the side of the new. For a useful countervision, see Tim Carmody’s “Bookfuturist Manifesto,” published in 2010, the same year that Steve Jobs was negotiating with the publishers.
