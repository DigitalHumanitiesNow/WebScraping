In case anyone didn't know, Flickr is a great place to find people preserving and sharing all sorts of history online. Recently, Jason Kottke linked to Ye Olde Metal Days, a photoset of 80s metal band photos. There's also this 1962 Fallout Shelter Handbook that's part of Flickr user "wardomatic's" Vintage Things collection. User "rocketeer" has a nice set titled WWII that include old World War II photos found in a used book purchased for a dollar at a library. In addition to creating sets, users are also adding their photos to various public photo pools on Flickr, like The World War II Vintage Photo Pool or The Old Photographs Pool. Also, you can also browse through all the images tagged "history."
