 “Answers raise the doubt.” Jimmy BuffettÂ Off to See the Lizard Before class today a student asked me, “What took you to Minnesota?” I thought about skipping the Habitat for Humanity bit of the story and just skipping right to going back to school. Â I opted for honesty instead. Â I gave them the short version of the story. Â I moved to Minnesota to work for Habitat for Humanity and open a ReStore. Â I went into a some detail regarding deconstructing houses to salvage the building materials for resale and salvage, while, at the same time, diverting the materials from the landfill. Â While I was in St. Cloud, I decided to go back to school and this led to a change of career for me. Â She said, “I was NOT expecting that answer.” Â Then it was time for class to start and I started with the day’s agenda. Even as I was talking I noticed something, a change in my voice, tone, and posture as I talked about the work I had done previously. Â My spine stiffened. Â My voice got a bit deeper and my tone more authoritative. Â I was completely at ease talking about my experience. Â I’m sure I could have easily walked the entire class through how to deconstruct a house, set up a store, price schemes, donor relations, customer service, and employee development almost without any pre-planning. Â Granted, it would take the semester to go over all of those things well, but my point is I could easily do it. When I went back to school most of my family and friends were surprised that I didn’t go for an MBA. Â After all, I had over ten years of management experience and the MBA just seemed like the logical next step. Â Instead, I followed my curiosity, first to Mass Comm and then to Rhet Comp. Â I passionately believe that writing is vital for success, no matter the career field. Â But throughout the day I kept wondering, “When will I find my voice in this second career?”
