The Perseids online collaborative environment offers a new pedagogical model for Classics in which students participate directly in the creation of knowledge. This presentation will detail two uses cases of Perseids. The first use case, in which a class collaborates to edit, translate, and annotate documents offers students an occasion to step out of the traditional Classical canon to process materials such as manuscripts and inscriptions. The second use case, dynamic syllabi using managed resources, lets professors assign texts for students to read and annotate, design tests, and gather data for student evaluation. This use case will be demonstrated for a language class and a Classical Mythology course.
