Today I’ll be joining a roundtable discussion hosted by the New York Council for the Humanities for its incoming class of public humanities fellows. I was asked to prepare a “top-ten list” for public humanists looking to get started in digtial humanities, and with the help of friends on Twitter, I came up with the following: 10) Enter the circle (read, tweet, blog) 9) Start with partners 8) Attend THATCamp 7) Write grants, not papers 6) Release early and often 5) Stop worrying about the definition of DH 4) Digital is always public 3) Must. Try. New. Things. 2) Break something 1) Lather, rinse, repeat Instead of explaining this advice in prose, I decided to put together a video. Here it is.  N.B. As my mother always told me, “do as I say, not as I do.”
