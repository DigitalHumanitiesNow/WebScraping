The Mosman community in New South Wales is preparing for the centennial of World War One, and as part of this project they've launched mosman1914-1918.net: "Doing our bit, Mosman 1914â1918".  The project describes itself as "an innovative online resource to collect and display information about the wartime experiences of local service people," and includes scan-a-thons, hack days, and build-a-thons.One of their efforts involves transcription of a serviceman's diary with links to related names on local honor boards.  I'm delighted to report that they're hosting this project on FromThePage.com, and I look forward to working with and learning from the Mosman team.Read more about Allan Allsop's diary on the Mosman 1914-1918 project blog and lend a hand transcribing!
