Roger Whitson of Washington State University has just reviewed The Emergence of the Digital Humanities on his site. Among other insights, Whitson detects a potential chiming of “eversion” and “emergence” that the editor and I did in fact notice when coming up with the title, and he embeds a famous clip of Louis C.K. riffing on technology to get at popular reactions to the eversion. He also thoughtfully points out that the book’s arguments about the social nature of the network sometimes work against its own calls for respecting the widespread alien-feeling, uncanny experience of the eversion today. In the end, Whitson says the book is “a true gift” and that it “uncannily explained [his] own experience and thinking.”
