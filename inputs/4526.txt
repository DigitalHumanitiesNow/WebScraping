Chris Long and I before taping an episode of Digital Dialogue. My article from the Queerness of Hip Hop Conference at Harvard is live! Message me if you want to read it but can’t because it isn’t open access. Thanks to conference organizers and guest editorsÂ Scott Poulson-BryantÂ andÂ C. Riley SnortonÂ for encouraging me to write it up! I was also fortunate to be a featured guest on Chris Long’s podcast Digital Dialogue, where I discuss the article in depth. Take a listen here. Audre Lorde tells us that naming is important. When she introduced herself as a âBlack lesbian feminist mother warrior poet,â she was deliberately situating herself and her perspective in a context of co-constitutive identities. Nikki Finney says, âRepetition is holy.â Lordeâs continual refrain of her many identities became an incantation of protection in all the spaces she entered, grounding her and signaling to others who she was. I identify as queer. When I call myself queer I do so with similar intention. My favorite definition of queerness comes from the âzineÂ Towards the Queerest InsurrectionÂ : [Q]ueer is not a stable area to inhabit. Queer is not merely another identity that can be tacked onto a list of neat social categories, nor the quantitative sum of our identities. Rather, it is the qualitative position of opposition to presentations of stabilityâan identity that problematizes the manageable limits of identity. Queer is a territory of tension, defined against the dominant narrative of white-hetero-monogamous-patriarchy, but also by an affinity with all who are marginalized, otherized, and oppressed. Queer is the abnormal, the strange, the dangerous. Queer involves our sexuality and our gender, but so much more. It is our desire and fantasies and more still. Queer is the cohesion of everything in conflict with the heterosexual capitalist world. Queer is a total rejection of the regime of the Normal. It is this definition that motivates my consideration of who and what gets placed under the umbrella of queerness. I am concerned about the wayÂ queerÂ is deployed in relation to hip hop because patriarchy, misogyny, capitalism, and other forms of kyriarchy often remain key ingredients in the lyrical production of artists purportedlyÂ queeringÂ the genre. I want to be deliberate in identifying phenomena that we see in hip hop that trouble our notions of what is imagined as the project of straightness, but also remain critical about the attachment of queer or queerness to that behavior. In wanting to name the particular homosocial behavior of black men in American (U.S.) hip hop culture, I offer the termÂ homolatentÂ : âhomoâ to foreground the same gender orientation of the behavior and âlatentâ to foreshadow the âpathologicalâ potential of queer desireâs rupture into the real. Additionally, afrofuturist Octavia ButlerâsÂ PatternistÂ book series hosts characters with supernatural powers that are activated through a painful transition process. For those who are unable to transition successfully, their âlatentâ powers manifest as a penchant for violence and nihilistic destruction waged on those closest to them. The violent nature of homolatent interactions sets it apart from traditional nomenclature used to describe same-sex attraction. Unlike âqueer,â âhomosexual,â or âsame gender loving,âÂ homolatentÂ attempts to address the abjection of desire. More here.
