In bed at the end of the day: check. In line at the coffee shop: check. In The Geekâs Chihuahua, Ian Bogost addresses the modern love affair of “living with Apple” during the height of the companyâs market influence and technology dominance. The ubiquitous iPhone and its kin saturate our lives, changing everything from our communication to our posture. Bogost contrasts the values of Appleâs massive success in the twenty-first century with those of its rise in the twentieth. And he connects living with Apple with the phenomenon of “hyperemployment”âthe constant overwork of todayâs technological life that all of us now experience. Bogost also reflects on the new potential functionâas well as anxiety and anguishâof devices like the Apple Watch. We are tethered to our devices, and, as Bogost says: that’s just lifeâanxious, overworked, and utterly networked life.
