 So, once in a while I play with building Omeka sites that are not actually part of RRCHNM tasks, grants, or contracts. It's a good way for me to bang on what I help build, and try to understand some of the real, practical needs out there in the world.   One of these side-ish projects is the US Museums Explorer, about which I've written a little bit for the IMLS, since I used their data, and about which I hope I'll write more extensively.
