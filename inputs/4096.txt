Recently added to British History Online is the first in a series of datasets for early modern London. Generated by the People in Place project, each dataset is focussed on family and household in a group of London parishes in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The first of the series are assessments for the  Marriage Duty Act, a form of taxation on the event of births, marriages and burials, and of annual payments by bachelors aged over 25 and childless widowers. The tax was in force from 1695 to 1706. Still to come are datasets relating to tithes, the parish vestry and the Poll Tax. The complete set of datasets are available for download as Excel files in SAS-Space, along with other outputs of the project. The People in Place project was a collaboration between Birkbeck, University of London; the Centre for Metropolitan History, Institute of Historical Research, University of London; and the Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure, University of Cambridge. The projectâ€™s co-directors  were Dr Vanessa Harding (Birkbeck), Dr Matthew Davies (Centre for Metropolitan History), and Professor Richard Smith (Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure).
