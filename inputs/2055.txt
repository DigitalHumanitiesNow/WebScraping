In the blink of an eye, sci-fi dystopia becomes reality becomes the reality we take for granted becomes the legally enshrined status quo: âOne of our top priorities in Congress must be to promote the sharing of cyber threat data among the private sector and the federal government to defend against cyberattacks and encourage better coordination,â said Carper, ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Of course, the pols are promising that data analyzed byÂ the state will remain nameless: The measure â known as the Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing Act â would give companies legal liability protections when sharing cyber threat data with the DHSâs cyber info hub, known as the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC). Companies would have to make “reasonable efforts” to remove personally identifiable information before sharing any data. The bill also lays out a rubric for how the NCCIC can share that data with other federal agencies, requiring it to minimize identifying information and limiting government uses for the data. Transparency reports and a five-year sunset clause would attempt to ensure the program maintains its civil liberties protections and effectiveness. Obama seems to suggestÂ that third-party “cyber-info hubs”—some strangeÂ vivisection of private and public power—will be in charge of de-personalizing data in between Facebook and the NSA or DHS: These industry organizations, known as Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs), donât yet exist, and the White Houseâs legislative proposal was short on details. It left some wondering what exactly the administration was suggesting. In the executive order coming Friday, the White House will clarify that it envisions ISAOs as membership organizations or single companies âthat share information across a region or in response to a specific emerging cyber threat,â the administration said. Already existing industry-specific cyber info hubs can qualify as ISAOs, but will be encouraged to adopt a set of voluntary security and privacy protocols that would apply to all such information-sharing centers. The executive order will direct DHS to create those protocols for all ISAOs. These protocols will let companies âlook at [an ISAO] and make judgments about whether those are good organizations and will be beneficial to them and also protect their information properly,â Daniel said. In theory, separating powers orÂ multiplying agencies accordsÂ withÂ the vision of the men who wrote the Federalist Papers, the idea being to make power so diffuse that no individual, branch, or agency can do much harm on its own. However, as Yogi Berra said, “In theory there is no difference between theory and practice, butÂ in practice there is.” Mark Zuckerberg and a few other CEOs know the difference, too. They decided not to attend Obama’s “cyber defense” summit in Silicon Valley last week. TheÂ attacks on Target, Sony, and Home Depot (the attacks invoked by the state to prove the need for more state oversight) are criminal matters, to be sure, and since private companies can’t arrest people, the state will need to get involved somehow. But theftÂ in the private sector is not a new thing. When a Target storeÂ isÂ robbed, someone calls the police. No one suggests that every Target in the nationÂ should have its own dedicated police officer monitoring theÂ store 24/7. So why does the state need a massive data sharing program with the private sector? It’s the digital equivalent of putting police officers in every aisle of every Target store in the nation—which is likely the whole point. Target, of course, does monitor every aisle in each of its stores 24/7. But this is a private, internal decision, and the information captured by closed circuit cameras is shared with the state onlyÂ after a crime been committed. There is no room of menÂ watching these tapes, no IT armyÂ paid to track TargetÂ movements on a massive scale, to determine who is a possible threat, to mark and fileÂ away even the smallest infraction on the chance that it is needed to make a case against someone at a later date. What Obama and the DHS are suggesting is that the state should do exactly that:Â toÂ enterÂ every private digital space and erect its own closed circuit cameras, so that men in suits can monitor movement in these spaces whether a crime has been committed or not. (State agencies areÂ already doing it, of course, but now the Obama Administration is attempting to increase the state’s reach and to enshrine the practiceÂ in law.) “As long as you aren’t doing anything wrong, what do you care?” In the short term, that’s a practical answer. In the future, however,Â aÂ state-run system ofÂ closed circuit cameras watching digital space 24/7 may not always be used for justified criminal prosecution. The next great technological revolution, in my view, will be the creation ofÂ an entirely new internet protocol suite that enables some semblance of truly “invisible” networking, or perhaps the widespread adoption ofÂ personal cloud computing. The idea will be to exit the glare of the watchers.
