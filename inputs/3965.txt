Even if I don’t feel up for dealing with foundation when I roll out of bed, I’ll still put the effort in for eyeshadow. I’m not much of a matte kind of gal, so today is all about six of my favorite glitter filled, shimmery brands. Kat Von D The Chrysalis palette has to be one of the best palettes I’ve owned. Moody, a little romantic, and a few shades that lean towards neutral in a pinch. If you’re a little anxious about going bold and dark, the texture base shades in the palette will help you dial down the intensity of some of the darker shades. I have a few of her single pan shadows, which serve as an excellent reminder that there’s always something new and different cycling through the line. It’s an all around great line for people who want to take adventurous steps with their makeup with a good quality brand. Available at Sephora. Urban Decay I bet you knew this one was coming! UD was one of those lines that drew me in as a preteen, goggling over the glitter and colour of a friend’s older sister’s makeup. My makeup shelf has three UD palettes on it, one of which is a build-your-own (an empty four slot pan, and four of my favorite UD shadows). UD products make good gifts for the glamorous goths, punks, and retro vintage beauty queens in your life. Available at Sephora and Urban Decay.      Concrete Minerals Vegan, cruelty free, gluten free, and full of some amazing pigments. I use their mineral eyeshadows, which are loose, shimmery shadows packaged in a sifter. I can’t speak to their matte shadows, but their mineral shadows have a much loved home in my makeup case. I tend to shy away from deep intensity shades, but Concrete Minerals has more than enough highlighters and soft-toned shadows to satisfy my sometimes pigment-shy preferences. Available at Concrete Minerals and Femme Fatale Cosmetics.   Atomic Cosmetics One of my friends took a trip into their shop on the hunt for a “mermaid” eyeshadow for me, and surfaced triumphant with a shimmery blue called Atlantica. Atomic Cosmetics is local to Seattle, and is run by a biochemist who made it her mission to put out makeup free of as many scary chemicals as possible. Good for anyone who likes shimmer, and a less chemical-filled beauty experience. You can find the AC line at their shop, at 617 E Pike St, Seattle, WA 98122. Glamour Doll Eyes At this point, if I count all the samples, I have a lot of Glamour Doll Eyes shadows in my makeup case. Their formulas are forgiving for people new to use mineral eyeshadow (I looked pretty funny learning to apply it). They’re also in a beautiful range, from basic neutrals to glam douchromes. Likely a good buy if you have oily eyelids like meâthey’re one of the few brands that doesn’t just melt off my lids over the course of a day. Available at Glamour Doll Eyes. Femme Fatale Cosmetics If you fear committing to a large shadow based on the swatch you saw on screen, FFC has mini sifter sizes, as well as a larger size for when you know that a shadow needs to be yours forever. These are beautiful loose mineral shadows, and the ship time from Australia was absolutely worth it. I have yet to find a match anywhere stateside to the FFC shades, and will continue to happily order/wait for my shipments when it means I’m getting beautiful shades like nothing anyone else has. Available at Femme Fatale Cosmetics.
