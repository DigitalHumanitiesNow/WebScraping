We are delighted to announce that six new volumes of the VCH for Wiltshire are now live on British History Online. The launch of volumes 5, 7, 11 and 13-15 completes the published coverage of the parishes of the county, and brings the total count of volumes up to 15, covering the parishes of some 18 hundreds, as well as principal towns including Devizes, Salisbury and Swindon.  Forthcoming highlights in local history include more in our series of county histories of the generation before the VCH; next launched will be Robert Thorotonâ€™s History of Nottinghamshire, as amplified by John Throsby in 1790.
