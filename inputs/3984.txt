Over the past few months I have been lucky enough to be involved in a project working with artists from Winchester School of Art to develop a series of training events looking at the relationship between art and archaeology.Â  This project has been a fantastic experience. Later this week, we are all going to EVA London 2013 to talk about the project, and I wanted to share with you the paper we’ve collaboratively written. But, more importantly, I wanted to say a big THANK-YOU to the team at WSA who have worked with us to make all of this possible. Thanks all! Making Digital: Visual Approaches to the Digital Humanities  CONFERENCE   Electronic Visualisation and the Arts (EVA 2013) London, UK, 29 – 31 July 2013 AUTHORS Gareth Beale, Nicole Beale, Ian Dawson & Louisa Minkin ABSTRACT The Making History Project is an attempt by artists and archaeologists based within the University of Southampton to collaboratively develop innovative uses for 3D technologies. Techniques such as high resolution data capture and 3D printing represent a new era in digital imaging. As these technologies become increasingly affordable they are coming to play a more significant role in archaeological and artistic practice. Both art and archaeology are currently involved in attempting to realise the full implications and potential of these technologies. This paper describes a project undertaken by the Archaeological Computing Research Group and Winchester School of Art at the University of Southampton which seeks to address this moment of technological disruption in order to collaboratively develop creative and methodologically innovative approaches to the use of these technologies.
