 A tentative syllabus for DIG 350: History & Future of the Book, a course just approved for the Digital Studies program at my new academic home, Davidson College. Many thanks to Ryan Cordell, Lisa Gitelman, Kari Kraus, Jessica Pressman, Peter Stallybrass, and many others, whose research and classes inspired this one. DIG 350: History & Future of the Book Course Description  A book may only be made of paper, cardboard, ink, and glue, but it is nonetheless a remarkable piece of technologyâabout which we have mostly forgotten it is a piece of technology. This class is concerned with the long history, the varied present, and the uncertain future of the book in the digital age. We will approach the history of the book in the most materialist way possible. In other words, when we say âbooks,â we donât mean novels. We donât mean texts. We mean books, the actual physical objects. Books have heft. They burn. They mildew. They smell. Their shape and design limit certain uses and encourage others. Similarly, books in the futureâor whatever replaces booksâwill foster certain practices over others. Over the course of the semester History and Future of the Book will return again and again to three central questions: (1) What is the history of the book as a physical and cultural object? (2) How have current disruptions in reading and writing technology changed the way we use and imagine books? (3) What does the future of the book look like? Along the way we will consider reading and writing innovations such as electronic paper, e-readers, touchscreen interfaces, DIY publishing experiments, and place-based authoring. We will also address what some critics call the phenomenon of bookishness in contemporary cultureâan exaggeration of the most âbookishâ elements of a book, which may represent either the last dying gasp of the printed book or herald a renaissance of the form  Learning Goals  By the end of the semester, students will be able to do the following: Evaluate key moments in the development of the book as a technological form Compare the affordances of different forms of textual technology (clay, scrolls, paper, books, screens, and so on) Dramatize the ways books and other technological forms reconfigure social practices Propose speculative designs for the future of the book Construct a technologically-enhanced book Question the significance of âextremeâ reading and writing technologies Required Reading House of Leaves, Mark Z. Danielewksi (Pantheon, 2000) Meanwhile, Jason Shiga (Abrams, 2010) Comparative Textual Media: Transforming the Humanities in the Postprint Era, eds. N. Katherine Hayles and Jessica Pressman (University of Minnesota Press, 2014) Various journal articles, book chapters, and online material, available through the library Moodle, and the class website Other Required Material Meanwhile app (available on iTunes for $4.99) Circuit Stickers (peel-and-stick electronic circuits, available for $25) Note: every student in DIG 350 will be issued an iPad for the duration of the semester. In addition to Meanwhile, students will selectively purchase and study two or three other relevant apps. Possibilities include LetterMPress, Strange Rain, Device 6, 18 Cadence, and A Humument.  Required Work  The graded work for DIG 350 will take several forms, detailed below: (1) class participation; (2) semi-weekly blogging; (3) an alternative House of Leaves model; (4) a book enhancement; (5) a mobile library design; (6) a comparative analysis final paper. (1) This class places a high premium on participation. It is essential that everyone has carefully considered the dayâs material, attends class, and participates. I also expect students to bring the dayâs readings to class, well-marked up with notes and annotations. Daily attendance is crucial for full participation. More than two absences will lower your class participation grade by at least one letter grade. More than five absences will result in a zero for your class participation grade. Participation is worth 10% of your final grade. (2) Each student will contribute to the class blog. There will be 15 prompts throughout the semester, and each student will respond to 10 of these. Each post should be approximately 400 words. See the blog evaluation guidelines below. Blogging is worth 20% of your final grade. (3) Every student will design an alternative form of House of Leaves, a book that epitomizes the phenomenon of bookishness. The Alternative House of Leaves model is worth 20% of your final grade (4) The book enhancement is a creative and critical engagement with the physical form of the book, using soft circuits or another type of I/O sensor to âhackâ the book. The enhancement will be accompanied by a reflective statement. The book enhancement is 20% of your final grade. (5) The speculative design of a technologically-enhanced mobile library, in collaboration with Caitlin Christian-Lamb, the Associate Archivist in the library. The mobile library design is worth 10% of your final grade. (6)Â Â  The final paper will be comparative analysis of a single or group of similar textual objects across print and digital forms. The final paper is worth 20% of your final grade.  Grading  The final grade will be calculated in the following manner: Participation: 10% Blogging: 20% House of Leaves alternative: 20% Book Enhancement: 20% Speculative Library Design: 10% Final Project: 20% I will evaluate the blog posts according to the following 0-4 point scale: RATING CHARACTERISTICS 4 Exceptional. The blog post is focused and coherently integrates examples with explanations or analysis. The post demonstrates awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers multiple perspectives when appropriate. The post includes at least one rhetorically useful image or media clip that illustratesârather than trivializesâits point. 3 Satisfactory. The blog post is reasonably focused, and explanations or analysis are mostly based on examples or other evidence. Fewer connections are made between ideas, and though new insights are offered, they are not fully developed. The post reflects moderate engagement with the topic. 2 Underdeveloped. The blog post is mostly description or summary, without consideration of alternative perspectives, and few connections are made between ideas. The entry reflects passing engagement with the topic. 1 Limited. The blog post is unfocused, or simply rehashes previous comments, and displays no evidence of student engagement with the topic. 0 No Credit. The blog post is missing, late, or consists of one or two disconnected sentences. Every other assignment will be given a letter grade that has a percentage equivalent: A = 95% /A- = 90% B+ = 88% / B = 85% / B- = 80% C+ = 78% / C = 75% / C- = 70% D+ = 68 / D = 65% /F = below 60%  Inclusive learning  I am committed to the principle of inclusive learning. This means that our classroom, our virtual spaces, our practices, and our interactions be as inclusive as possible. Mutual respect, civility, and the ability to listen and observe others carefully are crucial to inclusive learning. Any student with particular needs should contact Nance Longworth (x2129), the Academic Access and Disability Resources Coordinator, at the start of the semester. The Dean of Studentsâ office will forward any necessary information to me. Then you and I can work out the details of any accommodations needed for this course.  Academic Integrity  Students at Davidson College abide by an Honor Code. The principle of academic integrity is taken very seriously and violations are treated gravely. What does academic integrity mean in this course? Essentially this: when you are responsible for a task, you will perform that task. When you rely on someone elseâs work in an aspect of the performance of that task, you will give full credit in the proper, accepted form. Another aspect of academic integrity is the free play of ideas. Vigorous discussion and debate are encouraged in this course, with the firm expectation that all aspects of the class will be conducted with civility and respect for differing ideas, perspectives, and traditions. When in doubt (of any kind) please ask for guidance and clarification.  Classroom Courtesy  While this course embraces the digital world it also recognizes that digital tools and environments complicate personal interactions. Studies have shown that students who use laptops in class often receive lower grades than those who donât. Even more worrisome are studies that show laptop users distract students around them. I permit laptops and tablets in class, but only when used for classroom activities, such as note-taking or class readings. Occasionally I may ask students to turn off all digital devices. Text messaging or other cell phone use is unacceptable. Any student whose phone rings during class or who texts in class will be responsible for kicking off the next class dayâs discussion. Late arrivals or early departures from class are disruptive and should be avoided.   DIG 350 Calendar  History  Week 1 (August 25, 27 and 29) Key Concepts: book history Robert Darnton, âWhat is the History of Books?â in Daedalus 111:3 (1982): 65-83 In-class activity: Writing in Clay Leah Price, âYou are What You Read,â New York Times, 2007 Week 2 (September 1, 3, and 5) Key Concepts: paper and printing as technologies Visit to Special Collections Selections from Lucien Febvre and Henri-Jean Martin, The Coming of the Book: The Impact of Printing, 1450-1800 (1976) Week 3 (September 8, 10, and 12) Key Concepts: (dis)continuity and affordances Guest Speaker: Dr. Tyler Starr, Assistant Professor of Art Bonnie Mak, How the Page Matters (Introduction and Chapter 1) Adrian Johns, The Nature of the Book: Print and Knowledge in the Making (pp. 1-40) Joseph Dane, âOn the Continuity of Continuity: Print Culture Mythology and the Type of the Gutenberg Bibleâ from Out of Sorts: On Typography and Print Culture (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2011) Week 4 (September 15, 17, and 19) Key concepts: materiality of forms Peter Stallybrass, âBooks and Scrolls: Navigating the Bibleâ from Books and Readers in Early Modern England (2011) In-class activity: Simulating a medieval scriptorium Gerard Genette, âIntroductionâ in Paratexts: Thresholds of Interpretation, trans.
