"Historian Claims Nazis Did Nuclear Tests". Via Kottke.  "Putting God Back Into American History," by David Kirkpatrick. New York Times (registration required but free). Via Spinning Clio.  The Way We Were: Coming of Age in Postwar Washington, a review of Barbara Holland's When All the World Was Young. Washington Post (registration is free but required).  The Fabric of Our Lives, a review by Ira Berlin of Stephen Yafa's Big Cotton: How a Humble Fiber Created Fortunes, Wrecked Civilizations, and Put America on the Map. Washington Post (registration is free but required). I saw this book in Borders this weekend and wanted to sit down to read it. It seems to fit into the same thread as other books that use one object or product to frame their account of history. Take Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World, or Salt: A World History, both by Mark Kurlansky. I read Cod a few years back, and thought was alright.
