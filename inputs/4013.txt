This site runs on Jekyll, a static-site generator written in Ruby. As I create more and more figures to go on this site, it has become increasingly laborious to get the images, captions, and links properly formatted. So Iâve written a jekyll_figure plugin to automate the figures. A tag like this: {% figure filename svg,png,pdf 'Your caption here' %} Produces output like this:   Figure 1: Twelve names whose gender changed over time [SVG, PDF] You can get the plugin at GitHub or from Rubygems.
