The AAHC is currently having its annual conference. Sheila Brennan, Stephanie Hurter, and I have a virtual panel entitled "Past/Forward: Collecting, Teaching, and Writing History (in the Digital Universe)". If you have time, please visit the panel, read our presentations, and offer comments along the way. The conference goes from April 24-April 27, but our panel is open to the public and will be up long after the conference ends.   *[AAHC]: American Association for History and Computing
