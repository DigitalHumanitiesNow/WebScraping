Everyday Analysis has been a little âLacanianâ on current issues recently â not least the general election â remaining silent whilst the chatter continues all around and seeks to solicit responses, not to mention votes. With all the X-Factor-style playing-to-the-gallery in the media so far the election campaign machines this year have more than of late cottoned on to the atmosphere of voterly vacillation and sought to plug the electorateâs desiring-machines back into the social-, âpoliticalâ-, choice-, big Other-, Machine of full-on canvassaturation (to use a little Deleuze/Guattarian terminology). But what of this voterly âvacillationâ itself? To take one of so many ways in, we might discuss Ed Milibandâs agreeing to an interview with Russell Brand for The Trews, lambasted on the front pages of the established newspapers before the interview was even broadcast, from being described as a âgambleâ by the Guardian to the right-wing rags toeing David Cameronâs branding Brand a âjokeâ â whom he âdoesnât have to hang out withâ â line, Katie Hopkins et al of course forming his celebrity coterie, as the New Statesman states. But the New Statesman here somewhat misses the mark too, for what is implicit in most of the reportage is the dismissal of Brand â recently voted the worldâs fourth most influential thinker in a Prospect poll â as a âcelebrityâ, whereas in his capacity as producer of YouTube content and feature-length documentary the vacuity of fame alone being his sole defining characteristic hardly stands up, regardless of whether it may ever have. To say nothing of the episode of The Trewsâ content â the idiocy of the prior speculation around endorsement and conversion speaks for itself â which was to be expected (Brand does not renege on his position; Miliband argues his points; there will be other interviews with leaders (of the Greens, for example), dependant on who accepts the invitation), the Labour spokesperson who stated nothing more than that Miliband âhad done an interview on Monday nightâ brings us closest here to an analytical vantage-point.The treatment of The Trews, in this statement, as a media outlet, and of Brand as a journalistic interlocutor, is alien enough to the rest of the hyperbolic reaction from the mainstream TV and print news organisations â who see themselves, or rather endlessly strive to present themselves, as journalistic interlocutory media outlets â to show up clearly the very mechanisms at work here: the hegemonic attempt at expulsion of The Trews (and anything like it) from recognition as media or journalism. An expulsion, that is, from a carefully crafted âobjectivityâ, the definition of which mainstream media has itself imposed, in an attempt to delimit parameters of public perception.When Mark Fisher talks of âthe picture the reality managers have fed us for the last few years â the three âbigâ parties each offering a slightly different version of capitalist realismâ â he thus highlights very precisely what has been at stake not only in the manufacturing of a political assertion that has been slid into the place of âobjectivityâ (i.e., âcapitalism is realismâ) post-Crash, but also the occurrence of this in media representation surrounding this election, and of course in reportage generally. To bring what has been perceived as voterly vacillation (based on the occurrence of coalition and its likelihood again) back in here, it is maybe because of the rise of âalternativeâ media, like Brandâs Trews, but also like so many other online resources now, that the voting populace is becoming politicised, or politics-literate (something disenfranchising governments and elites have been happy to see low,                   amongst certain populaces,    when seats were safe). Indeed, this begs the question as to why our education and established media institutions havenât instilled this kind of political engagement themselves previously in the public, and of what might have been behind this disenfranchisement…At a recent hustings event a candidate for the Greens emphatically encouraged voting for âwhat you believe inâ; it is paradoxical that the voting system of Proportional Representation, which the Greens are committed to (and which the treacherous Liberal Democrats promised to have a referendum on, but then simply shrugged off when in âpowerâ) would be needed to be in place a priori for this to be really possible. Thus, the recognition, and then dismantling, of tactical-voting realism and hegemonic media-manufactured âobjectivityâ, through a rise in alternativism, might be our best hope for ushering in a challenge to the state of affairs which Brand has described as the ârigged gameâ.
