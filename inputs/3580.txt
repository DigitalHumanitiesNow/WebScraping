This is the text of a talk given at eResearch 2013, University of Canterbury, New Zealand, July 03, 2013.  I can only offer a very formative overview of this subject here, but I’m keen to at least put it on the radar. As everyone knows, vast amounts of our cultural heritage are either being digitized and put online or being born online, and this has significant implications for the arts and humanities. In particular, it forces us to start increasing our understanding of, and capability with, the engineered technologies that deliver resources to us online. It will always be difficult getting the balance right – we’re never going to be engineers – but we need to start working through the issues.
