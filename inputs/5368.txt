The SHared Access Research Ecosystem (SHARE)âa joint initiative of the Association of Research Libraries (ARL), the Association of American Universities (AAU), and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU)âtoday released the SHARE Notification System Project Plan ... .The plan details the first in a series of activities to be undertaken by SHARE to ensure that scholarly research outputs are discovered and built upon in a manner that facilitates and accelerates the research process. The SHARE notification system is consistent with higher educationâs ongoing mission to encourage community-driven solutions that increase public access to research and maximize knowledge creation.Funding agencies, sponsored research offices at universities, institutional and disciplinary repositories, and other interested parties have found it difficult to keep abreast of the release of publications, datasets, and other results of scholarly research. Across the disciplines, principal investigators and other scholars do not have any single, structured way to report on these releases in a timely and comprehensive manner. The SHARE Notification System is a higher educationâbased initiative to strengthen efforts to identify, discover, and track research outputs.[more] !!!
