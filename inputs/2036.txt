As increasing numbers of historical datasets are made available online, the         question of how best to mediate among them becomes more pressing. But the standard computational         approach to such mediation – the creation of a unifying framework ʻoverʼ the datasets – is problematic         in the context of historiography: often, for historians, the question of overarching ʻframeʼ is itself the point         at issue. This paper explores, with particular reference to Late Antique urban culture, the potential for         electronic tools to free the historian from this reflexive bind, and facilitate an ʻexperimentalʼ research         approach to history, as advocated by e.g. Marcel Detienne and other classicist anthropologists.
