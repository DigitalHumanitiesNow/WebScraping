2014 Digital HPS Consortium Annual Meeting: September 1-3 In Nancy, France Following the meetings held in Pasadena (2011), Cambridge (2012), and Bloomington (2013), the 2014 edition of the Digital HPS Consortium Annual Meeting will be held in Nancy, France, from 1 to 3 September. Organized by Olivier Bruneau, Pierre Couchet, and Scott Walter, with support from the Henri-PoincarÃ© Archives (University of Lorraine & CNRS) and the Maison des Sciences de l'Homme Lorraine, the meeting offers an opportunity for scholars in DHPS to present their publications, tools, and methods, to exchange ideas, and to form and nurture contacts with members of the international DHPS community. The working language of the meeting is English, but there will be plenty of occasions to practice speaking French, for those so inclined. Located in the Lorraine region of eastern France, Nancy is easily accessible by high-speed trains from both Paris and Charles de Gaulle airport (north of Paris). Travel directions, information on lodging, and a preliminary program will soon be available; stay tuned. Scholars wishing to participate in the meeting are invited to register online, eventually disclosing a title and abstract for a 30-minute talk at their earliest convenience. Tags: consortiummeetings
