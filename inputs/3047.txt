 Jon Satrom performs interesting glitch pieces. His portfolio consists of videos of his performances, full of color, chaos, and cats. There may be the JODI-esque tendency toward boundary exploration, but with pieces about rainbows and dinos, nobody is taking himself too seriously.  Satrom’s portfolio is fun, but more importantly it presents an interesting perspective of glitch art: its performative quality.  I’ve been deeply interested in the aesthetics of glitch work recently, specifically the idea that depending on the glitch process, the “art” might lie in the process—what was removed or changed—in the finished product, in the code, or any combination thereof.  How, then, do we showcase the interesting parts?  Satrom does live performances, and his videos certainly capture that performative quality.  We see the code. But we also see flashing colors, spinning beachballs, and ghostly almost-there moving images.  The art is in how it all comes together.
