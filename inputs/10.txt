The following checklist of 4Humanities tasks and volunteers (including volunteers for both technical and content tasks) is organized roughly according to the 4Humanities web site structure.  If you are already a member of the 4Humanities collective and have “editor” permissions on the site, please volunteer for indicated tasks or add/revise tasks. If you are not a member of the 4Humanities collective and have an idea for a project or task, you can leave a comment here.  Or, you can join us as a contributing member by sending an email to Alan Liu (ayliu@english.ucsb.edu).
