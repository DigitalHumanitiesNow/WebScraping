  I ran across this gem of a website while browsing CSS-Mania. The Baseball Music Projectis a group of musicians who are promoting songs about baseball written from the 1850s to the 1900s. From the "About Us" section:  Founded in 2004 by a group of music professionals with a nearly uncontainable love and passion for both baseball and music, The Baseball Music Project is dedicated to fostering greater awareness of the cultural lineage and historical significance of music written about baseball, through concerts, recordings, and related outreach events and projects.  The Orchestra Program features such hits as "The Umpire is a Most Unhappy Man," "The Baseball Polka," "Casey at the Bat," and "Slide, Kelly, Slide." The site's graphics are wonderful, the code is solid, and the project itself seems really interesting. The group will begin performing in 2006 in conjunction with "major symphony orchestras and concert halls throughout the USA".
