Fernanda ViÃ©gas and Martin Wattenberg have written a wonderful piece titled Design and RedesignÂ in Data VisualizationÂ about criticism in data visualization. They thoughtfully analyze the practice and point out some of the issues when people create redesigns, including intellectual honesty and perfect hindsight. They then go on to define some “rules of engagement” for a more reasonable approach to redesign. They argue for a kinder, more respectful, and more balanced process. Their ideas are informed by the critique in design and certainly make a lot of sense forÂ visualization. The piece was originally written for the Malofiej 22 book, and I’m glad that it has been published for a wider audience.
