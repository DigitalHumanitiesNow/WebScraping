The Lexicon of Greek Personal Names was established 35 years         ago to collect and publish all ancient Greek personal names. Thorough maintenance of the         IT infrastructure has enabled us to start making new uses of the data and enable         inter-project exchange. We will describe the Lexicon data model, its relationship to semantic         markup using TEI XML, web services which we can offer, and some of the novel         investigations which can now be attempted.         ((NOTE: due to hardware error, we have no audio file to upload for this seminar.))
