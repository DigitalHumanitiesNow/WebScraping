Armistice Day the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month â¦ when major combat ceased on the western front (fighting continued on other fronts). Armistice Day was officially amended in the USA to Veteranâs Day in 1954 to honor all those who had served. To those of you, especially my Dad, that served, thank you for your service.
