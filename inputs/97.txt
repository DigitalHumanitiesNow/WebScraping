 SEKâS LESBIAN FRIEND:Â Crap â just realized I wonât be able to make your birthday party. SEK:Â Thatâs fine. I didnât want to play any Indigo Girls songs anyway. SEKâS LESBIAN FRIEND:Â You were the one who introduced me to the Indigo Girls! Just play your favorite so I can attend in spirit. SEK:Â Fine â Iâll play âThe Wood Song.â SEKâS LESBIAN FRIEND:Â Your favorite Indigo Girlâs song is âThe Wood Songâ? SEK:Â Yes. SEKâS LESBIAN FRIEND:Â âTHEÂ WOODÂ SONGâ? SEK:Â What? Itâs gorgeous. SEKâS LESBIAN FRIEND:Â âTHEÂ WOODÂ SONGâ? SEK:Â Fine â âRomeo and Julietâ then. SEKâS LESBIAN FRIEND:Â WRITTEN BY A MAN! SEK:Â How am I losing this argument? SEKâS LESBIAN FRIEND:Â God damn straight people.
