(Ok, maybe a tad bit overdramatic.) I’ve had a chapter accepted for inclusion in what looks to be a really great collection called Rhetorical Ontologies. I’m writing on the “Dear Photograph” project, but every time I go to study the images I break down. I’m not typically the sentimental type, but these photos and their accompanying text are just getting to me. I’m not sure how to keep approaching this subject. I want to desensitize myself, yet at the same time I don’t. How can we analyze something we’re becoming more close to? (Is that what’s going on here?) I’m trying to view it from a material memory/temporal/pastiche aspect, but no dice so far. I’ll keep working.
