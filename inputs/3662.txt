Is it important that a universityâs senior IT person comes from a technology background?Â And if it is important now, will that still be the case as IT in HE continues to develop rapidly and the role of its senior managers evolves?                    Our view is that an IT background will come to matter less rather than more and that a variety of wider strategic business skills (and some softer ones, too) will come to the fore.You can find out if other people agree with that in the newly published Jisc and EDUCAUSE report, Technology in higher education: defining the strategic leader.Early involvementJisc and EDUCAUSE have been looking into the roles and attributes of institutional IT leaders since early last year. Because senior IT staff manage business critical services right across their university, and have a profound knowledge of how technology can support innovation, they are ideally placed to reimagine operations in ways that few other senior managers can.[#pullquote#]they are ideally placed to reimagine operations in ways that few other senior managers can[#endpullquote#]Moreover, when they don’t get involved in these discussions at an early stage and at strategic level, there is a real risk that it will prove difficult, expensive or even just plain impossible to implement an optimal technology solution to support the institution’s vision.They have huge potential to help in shaping the future direction of their universities. But if they are to rise to the challenge and take their place at institutional management level they need to know what will be expected from them and that they have the all the skills and support structures they need. The fast-changing nature of their work has made that more difficult than usual to do.CollaborationSo, collaborating with EDUCAUSE, we put together a working group of senior IT managers from universities in the UK and the US – including universities of huge size like the University of California in the US and, in the UK, Aston University, Cardiff University, Sheffield Hallam University and the universities of Dundee and Ulster.Over six months they gave their time generously for regular teleconference calls to define the characteristics of information leaders, to devise a model that fits information leaders in all institutions regardless of size, location or complexity and also to flag up the development needs that might be common to all - either now or in the next few years.[#pullquote#]they showed us solid examples of instances where a failure to consult the IT function had cost money and time[#endpullquote#]The conversations were open, rich and gave us lots of context that revealed exactly how senior IT managers are influencing policy and redefining their own roles. They also showed us solid examples of instances where a failure to consult the IT function had cost money and time, and hampered implementation of the best solutions.We presented the initial findings at last autumn’s EDUCAUSE Annual Conference and found both that there was widespread interest in the subject. We also discovered that the consensus within our working group was mirrored in the conference hall.The future[[{"fid":"2542","view_mode":"default","type":"media","attributes":{"height":"353","width":"250","class":"media-element file-default media--left"}}]]We took away what we learned from the working group and the conference delegates, using it to produce our joint report. We hope it will help to clarify thinking about the future of this important leadership role and also about how we can support senior IT managers with their personal development needs as their work becomes more challenging, more relevant and more exciting than ever.As organisations charged with supporting institutions to harness IT to benefit education, Jisc and EDUCAUSE focus on the people who make technology work just as much as we do on the technology itself.We’ll be talking more about this at Digifest in a plenary session in the afternoon of Monday, 9 March. We hope you’ll come along in person but, if you can’t, the session is also being streamed live.
