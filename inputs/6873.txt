I’ve seen some interesting stuff over the past month:   Sol Lewitt @ Mass MoCA.  From Mark Dion’s Octagon Room — which I’ve always wanted to see! — at Mass MoCA.   Anselm Kiefer’sÂ Velimir Chlebnikov (2004) andÂ The Women of the Revolution (Les Femmes de la Revolution) (1992) at Mass MoCA. We got there the day it opened!   Williams College’s new (visually vibrant, yet uncannily silent) Sawyer Library.  The brilliantÂ Hito Steyerl @ Artists Space, featuring, in the Walker Street gallery,Â projection on sand tables.  Quite possibly the only piece I liked in the entireÂ New Museum Triennial:Â AslÄ± ÃavuÅoÄlu’s “Long Ago Person Found.”    Robert Irwin’s electricÂ “Cacophonous” at PACE Gallery.   Cutesy miniatures in “Feel Big / Live Small” @Â apexart.    George Nakashima Workshop.   Wharton Esherick Museum.
