The UC Riverside Center for Bibliographical Studies and Research (CBSR) has won $405,000 to build software that will help edit and curate the English Short Title Catalog (ESTC). In the past, the CBSR won $48,500 from the Mellon Foundation for curating and expanding the ESTC.Â  The goal of the new grant is to allow scholars to help curate theÂ ESTC by adding information to entries.Â  According to aÂ  write-up in UCR Today,  Approval from ESTC staff will be required for changes suggested to core catalog data, which must remain intact for use by librarians . . .The new software will allow additional information provided by researchers to be recorded in different data fields, with safeguards designed to prevent errors. Congratulations to the staff at CBSR for this tremendous accomplishment.Â  For more information, see ucrtoday.ucr.edu.
