I have the honor of talking on Josh's Clio Wired course this evening. The topic for discussion, at least where I'm involved: Making simple movies with iMovie. If you haven't checked out the Clio Wired course for this semester, you totally should. Some very smart folks are blogging some very good stuff. Students include:  Alan Walker Amanda Bennett Bill Andrews Billy Wade Dieter Stenger Gwen White James Garber Jeff Bowers Jennifer Skomer Jenny Reeder John Lillard Karen Tessier Karin Hill Misha Griffith Steven Scott Tad Suiter Thomas Jenkins Subscribe to their blogs or stop by the course's blog feed, and be sure to leave comments!
