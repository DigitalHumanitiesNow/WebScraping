Sorry to remain quiet on this front.  Last night was my first use of anything narcotic in the process.  Which is pretty good, I think.  Codeine cough syrup.  It worked for the intended purpose (preventing dry coughing fits as I fell asleep) and I donâ€™t feel too wooly this morning. As to the dreams, the only one I remember is arriving in California and forgetting the cat at the airport and having to go back and get him.  (Though this may well have to do with dealing with his airline arrangements yesterday.) Also the highway was really messed up.
