 This is the floor of the bathroom in my hospital room.  While I was on dilaudid, it sometimes shimmered in interesting ways.  One night I stumbled in obscenely thirsty.  After several sponges worth of water in my mouth, I discovered it was physically possible to drink and swallow.  And the water was cold.  I wasnâ€™t supposed to do it, but I did it anyway.
