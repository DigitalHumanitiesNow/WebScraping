In making maps in R, the biggest point of pain for me has been reading in shapefiles. D3 has been far better for making maps because TopoJSONâs topological format for representing geometries is so much better than the format of shapefiles. Bob Rudisâs post âOvercoming D3 Cartographic Envy With R + ggplotâ taught me that the most recent version of GDAL/OGR can read in TopoJSON, and thus that the R package rgdal can as well. This will make mapping in R much easier.
