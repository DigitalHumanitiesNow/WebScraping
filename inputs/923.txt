In TV and movies men talk more than women, and women talk mostly about men. Hence the Bechdel test. But I thought Iâd do a dataviz for this phenomenon using Ben Schmidtâs implementation of Bookworm. His data scraper uses the Open Subtitles database of closed captioned subtitles for hundreds of TV shows. While it canât measure whoâs talking it can measure whoâs being talked about. Not surprisingly, the pronoun âheâ is substantially more common than âsheâ for all TV shows. The only exception is 1951 (at the far left), where the sample is small a skewed by a few episodes of âI Love Lucy.â  As you might expect, shows about women feature âsheâ more often, although even âGilmore Girlsâ has a lot of âhe.â But compare that to the dominance of âheâ in a testosterone-fueled drama like â24â  But how about Star Trek as a controlled experiment? The Star Trek spin-off âVoyagerâ featured Kate Mulgrew as Capt. Kathryn Janeway, in contrast to the male commanders on âThe Next Generationâ and âDeep Space Nine.â Again, no big surprise: more âsheâ with a woman in charge, although in only a few episodes does âsheâ actually exceed âhe.â     In an upcoming post, I’llÂ grab the raw data and post some “he/she” ratios, but this was too much fun not to share.
