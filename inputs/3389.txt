 I continue to be blown away by the courage in the face of bigotry displayed by the We Do Campaign. Watch the new video they’ve just released (embedded here) and contrast the self-righteous Bible quoting at the beginning with the quiet dignity and brave commitment to the path of love shown by Misha and Amy.  And then go give the Campaign for Southern Equality a few dollars.  Please also join our Mad4Equality March Madness tournament, which is raising money for the Campaign for Southern Equality and the Trevor Project.  Chris Bourg, a wonderful colleague of mine at Stanford, wrote a great blog post about Mad4Equality, in which she calls me out: And IÃ¢â¬â¢m calling out Bess Sadler right now to put up another $25 against my bet that my Blue Devils will dance longer than her Tarheels. Go Cardinal, Go Blue Devils! I accept. And I also back a similar bet that Stanford’s Nerd City Kids will dance longer than any other team anyone cares to name.
