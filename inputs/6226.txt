   Digital Dialogue 53  Originally uploaded by cplong11   On episode 53 for the Digital Dialogue, I am joined by Christopher Moore, Lecturer in Philosophy  and Classics and Mediterranean Studies at Penn State.Christopher received his PhD from the University of Minnesota in 2008. His areas of specialization include: Ancient Philosophy, Socrates, Aesthetics and Democratic Theory.   He has a number of articles in press and forthcoming, including:"Chaerephon, Telephus, and Cure in Plato's Gorgias," Arethusa (forthcoming May 2012)"The Myth of Theuth in the Phaedrus," in Status, Uses and Function of Plato's Myths, Catherine Collobert, Pierre DestrÃ©e, Francisco Gonzalez, edd. (Brill, forthcoming Spring 2012)"Socratic Persuasion in the Crito," British Journal of the History of Philosophy (forthcoming November 2011) I was very happy when Christopher joined the faculty here at Penn State because it offered me the opportunity to work closely with someone who really understands the nuances of Greek.  What better way to welcome Christopher, I thought, than to invite him onto the Digital Dialogue to talk about his very interesting paper on the connection between Plato's Phaedrus and Pindar's First Isthmian, a poem from which Socrates quotes early on in the Phaedrus. I hope you will enjoy our conversation as much as I did.   Digital Dialogue 53: Christopher Moore on the Pindar and the PhaedrusTo subscribe to the Digital Dialogue through iTunesU, click here.
