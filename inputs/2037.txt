In the context of Preparing DARIAH, the DCU engaged in a research         programme consisting partly of an empirical study of scholarly research activity. The study involved         24 interviews, and the largest groups of interviewees included archaeologists, historians and         classicists. What emerged was the diversity in the evidence and sources associated with Classical         Studies nowadays. Classicists indicated that in addition to text-based research they also use         objects, sites, and other historical-cultural material. This challenges earlier perceptions that         Classicists only employ strictly linguistic/textual methods of research. Moreover, it indicates the         evolving nature of Classics as an increasingly hybridized, thematic, and multi-methodological         interdiscipline.
