At I Annotate this weekend, I made a bookmarklet that will allow you to generate an Annotag from a book's bibliographic entry:   Tweet This Book  To use it:   Drag the button above onto your bookmarks bar.  Visit a website that has books. It currently works with Worldcat and Project Gutenberg.  Click the bookmarklet.  Add a location suffix to the hashtag, if you want, like :p26.  Tweet a comment about the book.  The bookmarklet extracts book identifiers from your URL, encodes it in base-62, and takes you to Twitter, where this information will be be waiting for you, encoded as a hashtag. Now it's even easier to tweet about books!   If you'd like to help improve the code, it can be found here on github.
