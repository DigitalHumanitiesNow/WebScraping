Iâll be on Graphic Policy Radio again tonightÂ discussing Foxâs new Batman-related showÂ Gotham. The show begins at 10 p.m. EST and youâre more than welcome to call in, tweet at me, or drop me a line on Facebook if you have something youâd like to add to the program â or if youâd just like heckle or berate me. The choice is yours!
