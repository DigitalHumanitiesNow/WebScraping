Binder aims to facilitate digital collections care, management, and preservation for time-based media and born-digital artworks and is built from integrating functionality of theArchivematica andAtoM projects. A presentation on Binder's functionality (Binder was formerly known as the DRMC during development) can be found here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPebm5nh83o.
