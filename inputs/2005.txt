For more than 30 years, computer scientists have discussed “literate programming,” an approach that treats computer programs as works of literature, as well as sources for machine instructions. I propose an approach to writing in the humanities that inverts that model, and treats scholarly prose as a source for machine-actionable citations, as well as a logical argument. I will draw illustrations from the Homer Multitext project, and will briefly survey how all of the information in its editorial work on Homeric manuscripts is translated into hundreds of thousands of RDF statements with citable URNs as their subject.
