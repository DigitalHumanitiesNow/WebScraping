This is the first post in a series about the role of html and css in the digital humanities. As I was finishing up a lesson on html and css for class today, I was, again, struck by the thought that html and css are primarily geared, it seems to me, around creating a digital edition. This is, of course, a necessary thing, but is it really digital humanities? Does teaching html/css come at the expense of other languages and skill-sets that are better suited and important in the digital humanities. I am and am not sure. Ultimately, htmlâs place in the pantheon of digital humanities skill-sets/languages is assured, but are the students missing out on other more important aspects of digital humanities? Or, as I am now beginning to think, are html and css the gateway drugs to the wider world of digital humanities skill-sets and languages that might make one a Ã¢â¬Ådigital humanistsÃ¢â¬Â? Could there be others as significant, if not more significant, in making one a digital humanists (if there really is such a thing)? Any thoughts, suggestions? For or against?
