				As you all know, the DH community is active and prolific. With that in mind, we are asking for your help to keep DHNow current. With the recent redesign of digitalhumanitiesnow.org and the reorganization of our Editors-at-Large management system, we thought now might be a good time to update the pool of RSS feeds from which our Editors-at-Large nominate content. Adding new feeds to the collection will provide our editors with a wider selection of news, resources, and conversations in the field.
We depend on our readers to keep this collection of feeds up-to-date and comprehensive, so this week, we are asking our twitter followers and our DHNow readers to submit their favorite DH feeds to be added to the Pressforward plugin. Feeds can be submitted through the form on digitalhumanitiesnow.org, or, for this week only, by replying to DHNow (@dhnow) on twitter with the hashtag #DHFeedFest. Editors-at-Large can also nominate feeds on the feedback form they receive at the end of their week.
Please take a minute this week to submit your favorite DH feeds!
