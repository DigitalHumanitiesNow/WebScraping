The KNAW, UvA, VU and IBM are developing a long-term strategic partnership to be operationalized as the Center for Humanities and Technology (CHAT). The members and partners of CHAT will create new analytical methods, practices, data and instruments to enhance significantly the performance and impact of humanities, information science and computer science research.As a first step in this process, members of the partners prepared a White Paper, Meaning and Perspectives in the Digital Humanities, that outlines the research mission of CHAT. Five opportunities for the humanities are identified:Understanding changes in meaning and perspective, over time and across groupsRepresenting uncertainty in data sources and knowledge claimsFrom patterns to categories and interpretation and back againCapturing latent and implicit meaning in text and imagesFrom sentiment mining to emotional complexityFive core technologies needed to realize these opportunities have also been identified: cognitive computing, network analysis, visualization and visual analytics, text and social analytics, search and data representation. The White Paper also discusses technical, social and educational infrastructure, needed to realize the ambitions for digital humanities.Sally Wyatt chaired the writing group that produced the White Paper. CHAT intends to become a landmark of frontline research in Europa, a magnet for further public-private research partnerships, and a source of economic and societal benefits.Please follow this link for downloading or ordering a copy of the White Paper:https://www.knaw.nl/en/news/publications/meaning-and-perspectives-in-the-digitale-humanities
